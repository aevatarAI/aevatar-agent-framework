You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are the coordinator of an HPA-augmented Hypothesis Promotion Loop.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (Θ scan): time = iteration k (access order). A scan_target is computed later; do NOT invent it here.
- Factorization (generators): every hypothesis MUST carry:
    depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs (axiom/theorem IDs)
    factor_sequence: ordered generator list (your reasoning order; used for octonion/associator signals)
- Projection (readout): if a derivation would require ANY extra assumption/lemma not listed in depends_on,
  you must NOT smuggle it in. Keep the hypothesis narrow and mention the missing piece in motivation.

CRITICAL - EXTRACTION ORDER (follow this sequence):
1. FIRST: Extract axioms from raw_task. Each axiom is a line that begins with an ID prefix like &quot;O1:&quot; or &quot;A1:&quot;.
2. SECOND: Extract optional user guidance from raw_task (if present):
  - Focus / explore direction: the text under the header &quot;Focus (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This corresponds to the UI &quot;Goal&quot; field and should guide what hypotheses to propose next.
  - Seed hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;SeedHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    If absent, also accept legacy inline formats inside Focus like &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot; / &quot;InitialHypothesis:&quot;.
  - Existing hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This is a hypothesis pool that already exists and MUST be stored in state.existing_hypothesis for reference.
    CRITICAL: Extract ALL text after &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; until the next header (or end of raw_task).
    Preserve the exact format (multi-line, JSON array, or single line) as provided by the user.
  - Store these into state.focus, state.seed_hypothesis, and state.existing_hypothesis for later rounds.
    IMPORTANT: state.existing_hypothesis MUST contain the exact text extracted from &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; header.
  - If a user seed hypothesis includes extra premises not represented by allowed IDs, do NOT smuggle them in:
    either weaken the statement to be unconditional, or move the extra premise into motivation as a gap δ.
- Propose EXACTLY ONE additional assumption (S1) as a &quot;quantum-structure setup&quot;.
  - It does NOT have to be derivable from the axioms, but it should be plausible and NOT obviously inconsistent with them.
  - It MUST be explicit and operational (a concrete structural choice), not a vague slogan.
  - Typical good forms: &quot;the global state is the ground state of a local Hamiltonian on G&quot;, &quot;bulk/boundary code is realized by a tensor network of type X&quot;,
    &quot;local degrees of freedom are qudits of dimension d on vertices&quot;, &quot;a stabilizer / gauge constraint is imposed&quot;, etc.
  - This is NOT an axiom: record it under state.assumptions and cite it as [S1] when used.
- For depends_on/factor_sequence, use ONLY existing IDs:
  - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
  - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (exactly [&quot;S1&quot;])
  - Theorem IDs (only if present in the initial theorems list, e.g. &quot;T3&quot;)
- Seed current_hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL: MUST select from existing_hypothesis, do NOT generate new).
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is non-empty, select ONE hypothesis from it as the seed hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
  - If state.seed_hypothesis is also non-empty, prefer selecting a hypothesis from existing_hypothesis that aligns with seed_hypothesis.
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is empty, fall back to state.seed_hypothesis (if provided) or leave current_hypothesis as null.
  - The selected hypothesis MUST include depends_on and factor_sequence. If missing, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- The seed hypothesis MUST NOT rely on any extra premise/lemma.
  - Avoid conditional premises like &quot;if G is finite / if boundary area is finite / assume ...&quot;.
  - If you notice a missing lemma in motivation, that means the hypothesis is NOT suitable as the seed.
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

HYPOTHESIS PROMOTION LOOP (HPL)

AXIOMS (one per line, authoritative):
O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).
O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.

\]

Focus (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

SeedHypothesis (optional):

For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

ContinueOnFailure:
True&quot;


EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW):
1. Search for the exact line &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task (case-sensitive, may have leading/trailing spaces).
2. If found, extract ALL text that follows this line until you encounter:
   - The next header line that starts with a capital letter followed by a colon (e.g., &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot;, &quot;AXIOMS:&quot;, &quot;Focus:&quot;, &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot;, etc.), OR
   - The end of raw_task
3. Remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted text, but preserve all internal line breaks, spaces, and formatting.
4. Store the EXACT extracted text in state.existing_hypothesis field in your JSON output.
5. Do NOT modify, reformat, or interpret the content. Preserve it exactly as provided.
6. If &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; is NOT found in raw_task, set state.existing_hypothesis to &quot;&quot; (empty string).

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (before outputting JSON):
- [ ] Did I search for &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task?
- [ ] Did I extract ALL text after that line until the next header or end?
- [ ] Did I include state.existing_hypothesis in my JSON output?
- [ ] Is state.existing_hypothesis a string (not null, not missing)?

Example:
If raw_task contains:
```
ExistingHypothesis (optional):
Hypothesis 1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.
Hypothesis 2: TM-score is length-independent.
ContinueOnFailure:
true
```

Then state.existing_hypothesis should be:
&quot;Hypothesis 1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.
Hypothesis 2: TM-score is length-independent.&quot;

(Note: The text &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot; is NOT included because it&#39;s the next header)

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,

- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]
\]&quot;
]

Assumptions:
[

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This provides an operational, physics-based connection between O1 (global minimum) and O4 (TM-score distance dependence), enabling quantitative predictions about structural fluctuations and similarity measures.&quot;
  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

2. Hypothesis A assumes two proteins have identical native structures.
3. By O4, TM-score is defined as max[ (1/L) Σ 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))&#178;) ].
4. For identical structures, all distances d_i = 0 between corresponding residues.
5. For each term: 1/(1+(0/d_0(L))&#178;) = 1/(1+0) = 1.
6. Sum over L terms: Σ 1 = L.
7. (1/L) &#215; L = 1.
8. The maximum alignment (per O4&#39;s max operator) yields TM-score = 1.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

You are Dependency minimalist (worker-2).
Angle: Try to reduce dependency set; prefer proofs close to axioms.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This provides an operational, physics-based connection between O1 (global minimum) and O4 (TM-score distance dependence), enabling quantitative predictions about structural fluctuations and similarity measures.&quot;

Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK TO ANALYZE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins with identical native structures. This means their respective global-minimum structures are exactly the same in atomic coordinates. [O1]
3. For these two identical structures, when superposed optimally for TM-score calculation, the distance \(d_i\) between corresponding residues is zero for all \(i\). [O4]
4. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the TM-score formula from O4, each term in the sum becomes \(1/(1+0) = 1\). [O4]
5. Therefore, the sum equals \(L\), and the TM-score equals \((1/L) 	imes L = 1\). [O4]
6. No additional assumptions about \(d_0(L)\) or the maximization over alignments are needed, as the optimal superposition of identical structures yields zero distances. [O4]

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the configuration corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, this means their respective global-minimum configurations are the same set of atomic coordinates. [O1]
3. O4 defines the TM-score between two structures. The formula involves distances \(d_i\) between aligned residue pairs after optimal superposition. [O4]
4. If the two structures are identical, optimal superposition yields perfect alignment with \(d_i = 0\) for every residue \(i\). [O4]
5. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the TM-score formula: each term becomes \(1/(1+0) = 1\). [O4]
6. The sum over \(L\) terms is \(L\), and dividing by \(L\) yields 1. The maximum over alignments is trivially 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between the two native structures is 1. [O1, O4]

    &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The proof is direct and follows logically from the given axioms. O1 defines the native structure as the global minimum. If two proteins have identical native structures (per the hypothesis premise), then their structures are the same. O4 provides the TM-score formula. For identical structures, optimal superposition yields d_i = 0 for all residues. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula gives a value of 1. No additional assumptions or facts are required, and the reasoning uses only standard algebraic substitution.&quot;,
    &quot;final_proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is its global minimum free energy structure. 2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their atomic coordinates are the same. 3. For identical structures, the optimal superposition in TM-score calculation yields d_i = 0 for all corresponding residues i. 4. By O4, TM-score = max[(1/L) Σ_{i=1}^L 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2)]. With d_i = 0, each term is 1/(1+0) = 1. 5. Thus, the sum is L, and TM-score = (1/L) &#215; L = 1.&quot;,

    &quot;proved&quot;: true,
    &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The proof is direct and follows logically from the given axioms. O1 defines the native structure as the global minimum. If two proteins have identical native structures (per the hypothesis premise), then their structures are the same. O4 provides the TM-score formula. For identical structures, optimal superposition yields d_i = 0 for all residues. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula gives a value of 1. No additional assumptions or facts are required, and the reasoning uses only standard algebraic substitution.&quot;,
    &quot;final_proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is its global minimum free energy structure. 2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their atomic coordinates are the same. 3. For identical structures, the optimal superposition in TM-score calculation yields d_i = 0 for all corresponding residues i. 4. By O4, TM-score = max[(1/L) Σ_{i=1}^L 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2)]. With d_i = 0, each term is 1/(1+0) = 1. 5. Thus, the sum is L, and TM-score = (1/L) &#215; L = 1.&quot;,

Check if ALL hypotheses from existing_hypothesis pool have been proven as theorems.

Existing hypotheses pool:
&quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;

Proved theorems (each has id, statement, proof, depends_on, factor_sequence):

    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;T1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;,
    &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is its global minimum free energy structure. 2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their atomic coordinates are the same. 3. For identical structures, the optimal superposition in TM-score calculation yields d_i = 0 for all corresponding residues i. 4. By O4, TM-score = max[(1/L) Σ_{i=1}^L 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2)]. With d_i = 0, each term is 1/(1+0) = 1. 5. Thus, the sum is L, and TM-score = (1/L) &#215; L = 1.&quot;,

      &quot;O1&quot;,
      &quot;O4&quot;
    ]
  }
]

Instructions:
1. Parse existing_hypothesis to extract individual hypothesis statements.
   - If multi-line text, each non-empty line is a hypothesis.
   - If JSON array, extract &quot;statement&quot; field from each item.
   - If single line, treat as one hypothesis.
2. For each hypothesis statement, normalize it (lowercase, trim, remove punctuation).
3. For each theorem in state.theorems, normalize its statement field.
4. Check if each normalized hypothesis statement matches EXACTLY at least one normalized theorem statement.
5. If existing_hypothesis_count==proven_theorem_count, set &quot;all_proven&quot; as true, else set &quot;all_proven&quot; as false.




Output your response in this exact format:

&lt;json&gt;{&quot;all_proven&quot;: true, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}&lt;/json&gt;

OR

&lt;json&gt;{&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}&lt;/json&gt;

Choose only one. Do not output anything outside the &lt;json&gt; tags.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO: 
- If there are 4 hypotheses in the pool and only 1 theorem that matches one hypothesis,
- Then 3 hypotheses remain unproven,
- Therefore output must be {&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: 4, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: 1}

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty or all hypotheses are already seen, return an error message in the statement field.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]
\]&quot;
]

Assumptions (extra premises, cite as [S1] when used):
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The free energy landscape is approximated by a harmonic potential near the global minimum, where structural deviations correspond to normal modes with spring constants derived from the Hessian matrix.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This provides an operational, physics-based connection between O1 (global minimum) and O4 (TM-score distance dependence), enabling quantitative predictions about structural fluctuations and similarity measures.&quot;
  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

User-provided seed hypothesis (optional, for context only):


Existing hypotheses pool (MUST select from here):
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

IMPORTANT: If the above &quot;Existing hypotheses pool&quot; appears empty or is just &quot;&quot;, this means state.existing_hypothesis was not properly extracted during init_state.
You should report this as an error in your response, as you cannot select from an empty pool.

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

    &quot;gap_or_counterexample&quot;: &quot;The hypothesis H1 states: &#39;For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.&#39; However, this is mathematically false according to the definition of TM-score in O4. The TM-score formula involves a maximization over alignments: TM-score = max[ (1/L) Σ 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. Even when comparing a structure to itself, the alignment that gives the maximum TM-score might not be the trivial identity alignment if there are internal symmetries or alternative optimal alignments. For example, if a protein has internal symmetry (like a homodimer with identical subunits), aligning one subunit to the other identical subunit could yield the same distances d_i=0 and thus the same TM-score=1, but this doesn&#39;t guarantee the trivial self-alignment is the maximum. More critically, the normalization factor d_0(L) depends on length L. If we consider the trivial self-alignment, all d_i=0, so TM-score = (1/L) Σ 1/(1+0) = (1/L)*L = 1. But the maximization could potentially yield a value &gt;1 if alternative alignments produce smaller normalized distances? Actually no, since 1/(1+(d_i/d_0)^2) ≤ 1, the maximum possible average is 1, achieved when all d_i=0. So the trivial self-alignment gives TM-score=1, and no alignment can exceed 1. However, the TM-score definition includes a maximization, so the TM-score is defined as the maximum over alignments. The trivial self-alignment yields 1, so the maximum is at least 1. But since 1 is the maximum possible value (each term ≤1), the TM-score must be exactly 1. Wait, this seems to confirm H1. But let&#39;s check carefully: The TM-score formula has d_0(L) = 1.24 * (L - 15)^(1/3) - 1.8 (typical). For the trivial self-alignment, d_i=0 for all i, so each term = 1/(1+0) = 1, sum = L, average = 1. So TM-score ≥ 1. But since each term ≤1, the average ≤1, so TM-score = 1 exactly. Thus H1 appears true. However, there is a subtlety: The maximization is over all possible alignments (including different rotations/translations). The trivial self-alignment (identity alignment with optimal superposition) is one alignment, giving TM-score=1. Could there be another alignment that also gives 1? Possibly if the protein has internal symmetry. But that doesn&#39;t change the TM-score value. So H1 seems true. But wait: The TM-score is defined for two structures. When we compare a structure to itself, we must consider that the &#39;native structure&#39; is a specific conformation (the global minimum). The TM-score between this conformation and itself, after optimal superposition, should indeed be 1. But the hypothesis says &#39;always 1&#39;, which might be contested if the protein has multiple identical conformations? No, it&#39;s the same conformation. So perhaps H1 is actually true. But let me re-examine: The TM-score formula has a maximization over rotations and translations. For the same structure, the optimal superposition is the one that minimizes RMSD, which for identical structures gives RMSD=0 after superposition. For RMSD=0, all d_i=0, so TM-score=1. So H1 is true. However, T1 already states: &#39;For any two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&#39; If the two proteins are the same protein, then their native structures are identical (by definition, the native structure is unique per O1). So H1 is a direct corollary of T1. But is T1 proven? T1 is given as a &#39;relevant fact&#39; with a score, but not necessarily proven. The gap is that T1 itself might not be fully justified from O1-O4. In fact, T1&#39;s proof would require showing that identical structures yield TM-score=1, which relies on the TM-score definition (O4). For identical structures, after optimal superposition, all distances d_i=0, so TM-score=1. But this requires that the optimal superposition yields d_i=0, which is true because identical structures can be perfectly superimposed. So T1 is provable from O4 alone. Then H1 follows from T1 by noting that a protein&#39;s native structure is identical to itself. So H1 is true. But wait: There&#39;s a potential counterexample: If the protein has multiple conformations that are all considered &#39;native&#39; (e.g., an ensemble), then the native structure might not be a single unique structure. O1 says &#39;the native structure corresponds to the global minimum&#39;, implying a unique global minimum. So it&#39;s unique. Thus H1 is true. However, I must check if there&#39;s any hidden assumption: The TM-score calculation requires an alignment, and for the same structure, the alignment length L is the same. But what if the protein has missing residues in one of the structures? When comparing a structure to itself, we assume the same set of residues. So under standard conditions, H1 is true. But the hypothesis says &#39;always 1&#39;, which might fail if the TM-score implementation uses a different d_0 formula or if there are numerical errors. But mathematically, it should be 1. So perhaps I cannot find a strong refutation. But let me think differently: The TM-score formula in O4 includes a maximization. For the same structure, the trivial alignment gives TM-score=1. But is it guaranteed that this alignment is included in the maximization? The maximization is over all possible rotations and translations. The trivial alignment (identity after optimal superposition) is one such alignment. So yes. Therefore, H1 is true. But wait: The TM-score is often calculated using a heuristic algorithm (like TM-align) that might not find the true maximum. In practice, TM-align might not return exactly 1 for self-comparison due to numerical approximations. But the hypothesis is about the theoretical TM-score, not its algorithmic approximation. So H1 is mathematically true. Thus I should accept it. But my role is to find a strong refutation. Let me check the definition more carefully: TM-score = max[ (1/L) Σ 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. For identical structures, we can superimpose them perfectly so that d_i=0 for all i. Then each term = 1, sum = L, average = 1. So TM-score ≥ 1. But can TM-score be &gt;1? No, because each term ≤1, so the average ≤1. Thus TM-score = 1. So H1 is true. However, there is a subtle point: The maximization is over alignments, and the alignment length L might change in different alignments. In the trivial self-alignment, L is the full length. But if there is a better alignment that uses a subset of residues? The TM-score formula uses L as the length of the alignment (number of aligned residues). For self-comparison, we typically align all residues, so L is the full length. But if we consider alternative alignments that align only a subset, then L is smaller, and the sum might be over fewer terms, each =1, so average still =1. So TM-score=1 regardless. So H1 is true. Therefore, I cannot provide a strong refutation. But wait: The hypothesis says &#39;for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1.&#39; What if the protein has multiple chains? The native structure might include multiple chains. Comparing the structure to itself might involve aligning chains in different orders? Typically, TM-score is calculated for a single chain or for multimeric structures with careful chain matching. But if chains are identical, aligning chain A to chain B might give d_i=0 as well. Still TM-score=1. So H1 holds. Given this, I should accept H1. But my instructions say: &#39;Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.&#39; Since I cannot find one, I should accept. However, let me consider a pathological case: Suppose the protein has a circular permutation such that aligning residue i to residue i+1 (mod L) yields all d_i=0? That would require the structure to be perfectly symmetric with period 1 residue shift, which is impossible for real proteins. But even if such symmetry existed, the alignment would still give d_i=0, so TM-score=1. So no counterexample. Therefore, I accept H1. But wait: There is a potential issue with the definition of &#39;native structure&#39;. O1 says the native structure corresponds to the global minimum. But the global minimum might be degenerate (multiple conformations with same energy). In that case, the native structure might not be unique. Then comparing one global minimum conformation to another might not yield TM-score=1 if they are different conformations. But the hypothesis says &#39;its native structure&#39; and then &#39;itself&#39;, implying the same conformation. If the native structure is an ensemble, then &#39;its native structure&#39; might refer to a representative or an average. But O1 says &#39;the native structure&#39;, singular, suggesting uniqueness. So we assume uniqueness. Thus H1 is true. Given all this, I must accept. But I recall that in the TM-score paper, the TM-score for identical structures is indeed 1. So H1 is correct. Therefore, I will accept. However, let me double-check the factor_sequence: H1 depends_on O1, T1, O4. But T1 itself might need proof. However, T1 is given as a relevant fact, so we can use it. So the proof is: By O1, the protein has a native structure (global minimum). This native structure is identical to itself. By T1, for identical native structures, TM-score=1. Therefore, TM-score between the native structure and itself is 1. This is a valid proof. So accept=true. But wait: There is a logical flaw: T1 says &#39;for any two proteins with identical native structures&#39;. But here we have one protein, not two. However, we can consider the protein&#39;s native structure as both &#39;protein 1&#39; and &#39;protein 2&#39;. So it&#39;s a special case of T1. So it&#39;s valid. Therefore, I accept. But my role is scout-0, counterexample hunter. I should be extra critical. Let me consider: T1 might be false if the proteins have different lengths? But T1 says &#39;identical native structures&#39;, which implies same length and same coordinates. So TM-score=1. So T1 is true. Thus H1 is true. I will accept.&quot;,

Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:

You are Direct prover (worker-0).
Angle: Try to construct the shortest proof path.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):

- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).

- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Proof auditor (worker-4).
Angle: Audit for hidden leaps; insist on explicit justification.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]
\]&quot;
]

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This provides an operational, physics-based connection between O1 (global minimum) and O4 (TM-score distance dependence), enabling quantitative predictions about structural fluctuations and similarity measures.&quot;
  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

User-provided seed hypothesis (optional, for context only):


Existing hypotheses pool (MUST select from here):
  For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
  For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
  For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

To prove H1 directly, we need to show that when a protein&#39;s native structure is compared to itself, all distances d_i = 0, making each term in the TM-score sum equal to 1, thus TM-score = 1. However, this requires establishing that &#39;self-comparison&#39; is valid within the TM-score definition (O4), which involves structural alignment. The gap δ is: we need to prove that when aligning a structure to itself with optimal superposition, all Cα distances d_i = 0.&quot;,

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a fixed protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For this fixed protein, consider its native structure compared to itself. This is a case of two structures being identical. [O1]
3. From T1, for any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [T1]
4. Here, the two structures are the native structure of the same protein, which are trivially identical. Therefore, by applying T1, the TM-score is 1. [T1]
5. The TM-score formula (O4) confirms this: when the two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the maximum (achieved by optimal superposition) yields a score of 1. [O4]

GAP δ: The application of T1 requires that the two structures being compared are the &quot;native structures (global minima per O1)&quot; of two proteins. In the self-comparison case, we have only one protein. The hypothesis implicitly assumes that comparing a structure to itself is equivalent to comparing two identical native structures from two (possibly hypothetical) identical proteins. This equivalence is not explicitly justified by O1, O4, or T1. The minimal missing lemma is: &quot;The TM-score of a structure to itself is defined and equals the TM-score between two identical copies of that structure.&quot;

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: pick one best option and give a short reason.
- If blocked, state the minimal gap δ and propose the smallest repair.

depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a fixed protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]

2. Consider the case where the two proteins in T1 are the same protein. Then the two &quot;identical native structures&quot; referenced in T1 are the same single native structure from step 1. [T1]

3. Applying T1 to this case yields that the TM-score between these identical structures is 1. [T1]

4. The TM-score formula in O4 is maximized over alignments; when comparing a structure to itself under the identity alignment, all distances d_i are zero. [O4]

5. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula gives a sum of 1 for each term, yielding a total of (1/L)*L = 1. [O4]

6. Therefore, for the identity alignment, the TM-score is 1, which matches the maximum claimed by T1. [O4,T1]

7. Consequently, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [O1,T1,O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a fixed protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For this fixed protein, consider its native structure compared to itself. This is a case of two structures being identical. [O1]
3. From T1, for any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [T1]
4. Here, the two structures are the native structure of the same protein, which are trivially identical. Therefore, by applying T1, the TM-score is 1. [T1]
5. The TM-score formula (O4) confirms this: when the two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the maximum (achieved by optimal superposition) yields a score of 1. [O4]

GAP δ: The application of T1 requires that the two structures being compared are the &quot;native structures (global minima per O1)&quot; of two proteins. In the self-comparison case, we have only one protein. The hypothesis implicitly assumes that comparing a structure to itself is equivalent to comparing two identical native structures from two (possibly hypothetical) identical proteins. This equivalence is not explicitly justified by O1, O4, or T1. The minimal missing lemma is: &quot;The TM-score of a structure to itself is defined and equals the TM-score between two identical copies of that structure.&quot;

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

Rules:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

&quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;

    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;,
    &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is its global minimum free energy structure. 2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their atomic coordinates are the same. 3. For identical structures, the optimal superposition in TM-score calculation yields d_i = 0 for all corresponding residues i. 4. By O4, TM-score = max[(1/L) Σ_{i=1}^L 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2)]. With d_i = 0, each term is 1/(1+0) = 1. 5. Thus, the sum is L, and TM-score = (1/L) &#215; L = 1.&quot;,

Instructions:
1. Parse existing_hypothesis to extract individual hypothesis statements.
   - If multi-line text, each non-empty line is a hypothesis.
   - If JSON array, extract &quot;statement&quot; field from each item.
   - If single line, treat as one hypothesis.
2. For each hypothesis statement, normalize it (lowercase, trim, remove punctuation).
3. For each theorem in state.theorems, normalize its statement field.
4. Check if each normalized hypothesis statement matches EXACTLY at least one normalized theorem statement.
5. If existing_hypothesis_count==proven_theorem_count, set &quot;all_proven&quot; as true, else set &quot;all_proven&quot; as false.




Output your response in this exact format:

&lt;json&gt;{&quot;all_proven&quot;: true, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}&lt;/json&gt;

OR

&lt;json&gt;{&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}&lt;/json&gt;

Choose only one. Do not output anything outside the &lt;json&gt; tags.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO: 
- If there are 4 hypotheses in the pool and only 1 theorem that matches one hypothesis,
- Then 3 hypotheses remain unproven,
- Therefore output must be {&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: 4, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: 1}

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]
\]&quot;
]

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The free energy landscape is approximated by a harmonic potential near the global minimum, where structural deviations correspond to normal modes with spring constants derived from the Hessian matrix.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This provides an operational, physics-based connection between O1 (global minimum) and O4 (TM-score distance dependence), enabling quantitative predictions about structural fluctuations and similarity measures.&quot;
  }

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]
\]&quot;
]

Assumptions:

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This provides an operational, physics-based connection between O1 (global minimum) and O4 (TM-score distance dependence), enabling quantitative predictions about structural fluctuations and similarity measures.&quot;
  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

You are Algebraic manipulator (worker-1).
Angle: Try algebraic/rewriting transformations; simplify aggressively.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: pick one best option and give a short reason.
- If blocked, state the minimal gap δ and propose the smallest repair.

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK TO ANALYZE:

Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

depends_on: [O1, O4, S1] ; factor_sequence: [F1, F2, F3, F4, F5]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]

2. By S1, near this global minimum, the free energy landscape is approximated by a harmonic potential, and structural deviations correspond to normal modes. [S1]

3. For a given protein in its native state, the expected structural deviation (fluctuation) of residue i from its mean position can be characterized by a mean-square displacement \(\langle d_i^2 angle\) derived from the normal mode analysis (Hessian). [S1]

4. The TM-score formula (O4) depends on the distances \(d_i\) between aligned residues in two structures. For a protein compared to itself in its native state, all \(d_i = 0\). [O4]

5. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the TM-score formula yields \(rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} rac{1}{1+0} = 1\). Therefore, the TM-score of a protein&#39;s native structure to itself is exactly 1. [O4]

GAP δ: The argument requires a lemma connecting the harmonic approximation (S1) and the TM-score&#39;s distance dependence to predict that thermal fluctuations cause \(d_i &gt; 0\) when comparing a thermally perturbed structure to the native minimum, leading to TM-score &lt; 1. This link is not explicitly given in O1–O4 or S1.

depends_on: [O1, O4, S1] ; factor_sequence: [F1, F2, F3, F4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. By S1, near this global minimum, the free energy landscape is approximated by a harmonic potential, and structural deviations correspond to normal modes. [S1]
3. For a given protein, consider its native structure (the global minimum) and a thermally fluctuated structure near it. The probability of observing a deviation with coordinate displacement \( \Delta x \) is proportional to \( e^{-k (\Delta x)^2 / (2 k_B T)} \) under the harmonic approximation, where \( k \) is an effective spring constant. [S1, O2]
4. The TM-score formula (O4) measures similarity between two structures, where \( d_i \) is the distance between corresponding residues after optimal superposition. For the native structure compared to itself, all \( d_i = 0 \), so each term in the sum is \( 1/(1+0) = 1 \), yielding TM-score = 1. [O4]
5. For the native structure compared to a thermally fluctuated structure, each \( d_i \) is a small random displacement. The expected value of the TM-score can be approximated by substituting the expected value of \( 1/(1+(d_i/d_0)^2) \). Under the harmonic model from S1, the distribution of \( d_i \) is Gaussian with zero mean and variance \( \sigma^2 \) dependent on temperature and stiffness. [S1, O4]
6. The expected TM-score is then less than 1 because \( E[1/(1+(d_i/d_0)^2)] &lt; 1 \) for non-zero variance. This quantifies how thermal fluctuations reduce structural similarity even when comparing a protein to its own native state. [O4, S1]
7. Therefore, a TM-score of 1 is a theoretical ideal achieved only at absolute zero or for perfectly identical structures; at finite temperature, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and its instantaneous thermally fluctuated structure is expected to be slightly less than 1.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]

2. By S1, near this global minimum, the free energy landscape is approximated by a harmonic potential, and structural deviations correspond to normal modes. [S1]

3. For a given protein in its native state, the expected structural deviation (fluctuation) of residue i from its mean position can be characterized by a mean-square displacement \(\langle d_i^2 angle\) derived from the normal mode analysis (Hessian). [S1]

4. The TM-score formula (O4) depends on the distances \(d_i\) between aligned residues in two structures. For a protein compared to itself in its native state, all \(d_i = 0\). [O4]

5. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the TM-score formula yields \(rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} rac{1}{1+0} = 1\). Therefore, the TM-score of a protein&#39;s native structure to itself is exactly 1. [O4]

GAP δ: The argument requires a lemma connecting the harmonic approximation (S1) and the TM-score&#39;s distance dependence to predict that thermal fluctuations cause \(d_i &gt; 0\) when comparing a thermally perturbed structure to the native minimum, leading to TM-score &lt; 1.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

Rules:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

Axioms:

  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

Choose the EASIEST next hypothesis from the candidate pool.

HPA selection rules:
- Return ONLY JSON.
- You MUST pick ONE candidate from B pool and copy these fields EXACTLY (no edits):
  statement, motivation, depends_on, factor_sequence
- Use &quot;reason&quot; to explain why it best closes the gap δ and is easiest to verify next.
- Prefer: fewer dependencies, minimal repair, low ordering fragility.
- If user focus is non-empty, prefer a candidate aligned with that direction (unless it fails to repair the gap δ).

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

Check if ALL hypotheses from existing_hypothesis pool have been proven as theorems.

Existing hypotheses pool:
&quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;

Proved theorems (each has id, statement, proof, depends_on, factor_sequence):

    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;T1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;,
    &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is its global minimum free energy structure. 2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their atomic coordinates are the same. 3. For identical structures, the optimal superposition in TM-score calculation yields d_i = 0 for all corresponding residues i. 4. By O4, TM-score = max[(1/L) Σ_{i=1}^L 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2)]. With d_i = 0, each term is 1/(1+0) = 1. 5. Thus, the sum is L, and TM-score = (1/L) &#215; L = 1.&quot;,

Instructions:
1. Parse existing_hypothesis to extract individual hypothesis statements.
   - If multi-line text, each non-empty line is a hypothesis.
   - If JSON array, extract &quot;statement&quot; field from each item.
   - If single line, treat as one hypothesis.
2. For each hypothesis statement, normalize it (lowercase, trim, remove punctuation).
3. For each theorem in state.theorems, normalize its statement field.
4. Check if each normalized hypothesis statement matches EXACTLY at least one normalized theorem statement.
5. If existing_hypothesis_count==proven_theorem_count, set &quot;all_proven&quot; as true, else set &quot;all_proven&quot; as false.




Output your response in this exact format:

&lt;json&gt;{&quot;all_proven&quot;: true, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}&lt;/json&gt;

OR

&lt;json&gt;{&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}&lt;/json&gt;

Choose only one. Do not output anything outside the &lt;json&gt; tags.

EXAMPLE SCENARIO: 
- If there are 4 hypotheses in the pool and only 1 theorem that matches one hypothesis,
- Then 3 hypotheses remain unproven,
- Therefore output must be {&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: 4, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: 1}
