## Input

<details open><summary>Axioms</summary><pre>
O1: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Every  $n\in M$ can be written uniquely as a prime number or a product of prime numbers. $$
    n=\prod_{p\in\PP} p^{a_p(n)},\qquad a_p(n)\in\NN,\quad a_p(n)=0\text{ for all but finitely many }p.
    $$
O2: Fix a weight function $w:\PP\to\RR$. Define the radial character
$$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$
where $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$. Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.
O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by
$$
\theta_\times(n)\equiv \sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\,\beta(p)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$ Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$,
$$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$
O4: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Define a map $\mathcal{Z}:M\to\CC^*$ by
$$
\mathcal{Z}(n):=\rho_w(n)\,\e^{\iu\theta_\times(n)},
$$ where $$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$, $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$ and $$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$.
O5: Let $\\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra.\nWrite an octonion in the standard basis as\n$\nx=x_0+\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nwith $x_i\\in\\RR$.\nDefine octonionic conjugation by\n$\n\\bar{x}:=x_0-\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nand the norm by\n$\nN(x):=x\\bar{x}=\\bar{x}x\\in\\RR_{\\ge 0}.\n$\nDefine $\\|x\\|:=\\sqrt{N(x)}$ and the unit sphere\n$\nS^7:=\\{u\\in\\OO:\\ N(u)=1\\}.$
O6: Let $E_8\subset\RR^8$ be the root lattice
$$
E_8:=\Big\{v\in\ZZ^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}\ \cup\
\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.
O7: For a rational prime $p\in\PP$, define the norm-$p$ shell
$$
\OO_p:=\{\pi\in\OHur:\ N(\pi)=p\}.
$$

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are the coordinator of an HPA-augmented Hypothesis Promotion Loop.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (Θ scan): time = iteration k (access order). A scan_target is computed later; do NOT invent it here.
- Factorization (generators): every hypothesis MUST carry:
    depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs (axiom/theorem IDs)
    factor_sequence: ordered generator list (your reasoning order; used for octonion/associator signals)
- Projection (readout): if a derivation would require ANY extra assumption/lemma not listed in depends_on,
  you must NOT smuggle it in. Keep the hypothesis narrow and mention the missing piece in motivation.

CRITICAL - EXTRACTION ORDER (follow this sequence):
1. FIRST: Extract axioms from raw_task. Each axiom is a line that begins with an ID prefix like &quot;O1:&quot; or &quot;A1:&quot;.
2. SECOND: Extract optional user guidance from raw_task (if present):
  - Focus / explore direction: the text under the header &quot;Focus (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This corresponds to the UI &quot;Goal&quot; field and should guide what hypotheses to propose next.
  - Seed hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;SeedHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    If absent, also accept legacy inline formats inside Focus like &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot; / &quot;InitialHypothesis:&quot;.
  - Existing hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This is a hypothesis pool that already exists and MUST be stored in state.existing_hypothesis for reference.
    CRITICAL: Extract ALL text after &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; until the next header (or end of raw_task).
  - Store these into state.focus, state.seed_hypothesis, and state.existing_hypothesis for later rounds.
  - If a user seed hypothesis includes extra premises not represented by allowed IDs, do NOT smuggle them in:
    either weaken the statement to be unconditional, or move the extra premise into motivation as a gap δ.
- Propose EXACTLY ONE additional assumption (S1) as a &quot;quantum-structure setup&quot;.
  - It does NOT have to be derivable from the axioms, but it should be plausible and NOT obviously inconsistent with them.
  - It MUST be explicit and operational (a concrete structural choice), not a vague slogan.
  - Typical good forms: &quot;the global state is the ground state of a local Hamiltonian on G&quot;, &quot;bulk/boundary code is realized by a tensor network of type X&quot;,
    &quot;local degrees of freedom are qudits of dimension d on vertices&quot;, &quot;a stabilizer / gauge constraint is imposed&quot;, etc.
  - This is NOT an axiom: record it under state.assumptions and cite it as [S1] when used.
- For depends_on/factor_sequence, use ONLY existing IDs:
  - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
  - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (exactly [&quot;S1&quot;])
  - Theorem IDs (only if present in the initial theorems list, e.g. &quot;T3&quot;)
- Seed current_hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL: MUST select from existing_hypothesis, do NOT generate new).
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is non-empty, select ONE hypothesis from it as the seed hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
  - If state.seed_hypothesis is also non-empty, prefer selecting a hypothesis from existing_hypothesis that aligns with seed_hypothesis.
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is empty, fall back to state.seed_hypothesis (if provided) or leave current_hypothesis as null.
  - The selected hypothesis MUST include depends_on and factor_sequence. If missing, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If no ExistingHypothesis is provided, seed an initial hypothesis (current_hypothesis) that is plausibly derivable.
  - Avoid conditional premises like &quot;if G is finite / if boundary area is finite / assume ...&quot;.
  - If you notice a missing lemma in motivation, that means the hypothesis is NOT suitable as the seed.
CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- CRITICAL: Do NOT repeat the last field (status) or any other field after the closing brace.
- The JSON object MUST end with a single closing brace }. Nothing should come after it.

EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW):
1. Search for the exact line &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task (case-sensitive, may have leading/trailing spaces).
2. If found, extract ALL text that follows this line until you encounter:
   - The next header line that starts with a capital letter followed by a colon (e.g., &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot;, &quot;AXIOMS:&quot;, &quot;Focus:&quot;, &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot;, etc.), OR
   - The end of raw_task
3. Remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted text, but preserve all internal line breaks, spaces, and formatting.
4. Store the EXACT extracted text in state.existing_hypothesis field in your JSON output.
5. Do NOT modify, reformat, or interpret the content. Preserve it exactly as provided.
6. If &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; is NOT found in raw_task, set state.existing_hypothesis to &quot;&quot; (empty string).

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (before outputting JSON):
- [ ] Did I search for &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task?
- [ ] Did I extract ALL text after that line until the next header or end?
- [ ] Did I include state.existing_hypothesis in my JSON output?
- [ ] Is state.existing_hypothesis a string (not null, not missing)?

Example:
If raw_task contains:
```
ExistingHypothesis (optional):
Hypothesis 1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.
Hypothesis 2: TM-score is length-independent.
ContinueOnFailure:
true
```

Then state.existing_hypothesis should be:
[&quot;H1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.“, &quot;H2: TM-score is length-independent.&quot;]

(Note: The text &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot; is NOT included because it&#39;s the next header)

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.

  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts, is physically plausible or logically correct should NOT cause accept=false.

Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions).

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.

Fast-consensus mode:

You are Algebraic manipulator (worker-1).
Angle: Try algebraic/rewriting transformations; simplify aggressively.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
   * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts with some implicit steps that are physically plausible
  
  * What constitutes a valid derivation:
    1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
    2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
    3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
    4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
  
  * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
    1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
    2. Counterexample exists
    3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
  
  * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
    - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
    - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts, is physically plausible or logically correct should NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

You are Case-split specialist (worker-3).
Angle: Try a structured case analysis; look for missing branches.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
   * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts with some implicit steps that are physically plausible
  
  * What constitutes a valid derivation:
    1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
    2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
    3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
    4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
  
  * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
    1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
    2. Counterexample exists
    3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
  
  * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
    - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
    - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts, is physically plausible or logically correct should NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Every  $n\in M$ can be written uniquely as a prime number or a product of prime numbers. $$
    n=\prod_{p\in\PP} p^{a_p(n)},\qquad a_p(n)\in\NN,\quad a_p(n)=0\text{ for all but finitely many }p.

$$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$
where $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$. Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by
$$
\theta_\times(n)\equiv \sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\,\beta(p)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$ Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)

be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$,

\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$&quot;,
  &quot;O4: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Define a map $\mathcal{Z}:M\to\CC^*$ by
$$
\mathcal{Z}(n):=\rho_w(n)\,\e^{\iu\theta_\times(n)},
$$ where $$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$, $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$ and $$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$.&quot;,
  &quot;O5: Let $\\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra.\nWrite an octonion in the standard basis as\n$\nx=x_0+\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nwith $x_i\\in\\RR$.\nDefine octonionic conjugation by\n$\n\\bar{x}:=x_0-\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nand the norm by\n$\nN(x):=x\\bar{x}=\\bar{x}x\\in\\RR_{\\ge 0}.\n$\nDefine $\\|x\\|:=\\sqrt{N(x)}$ and the unit sphere\n$\nS^7:=\\{u\\in\\OO:\\ N(u)=1\\}.$&quot;,
  &quot;O6: Let $E_8\subset\RR^8$ be the root lattice
$$
E_8:=\Big\{v\in\ZZ^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}\ \cup\
\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,
  &quot;O7: For a rational prime $p\in\PP$, define the norm-$p$ shell
$$
\OO_p:=\{\pi\in\OHur:\ N(\pi)=p\}.\n$$&quot;

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The octonionic embedding of integers is defined by mapping each integer n to an octonion in the maximal order OHur via a canonical left-normed product of prime octonions π_p in OO_p, where for each prime p, a fixed representative π_p in OO_p is chosen.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

  &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O2, ρ_w(mn) = ρ_w(m) ρ_w(n). [O2]
2. By O3, θ_&#215;(mn) ≡ θ_&#215;(m) + θ_&#215;(n) (mod 2π). [O3]
3. By O4, Z(n) = ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)). [O4]
4. Compute Z(mn) = ρ_w(mn) exp(i θ_&#215;(mn)). [O4]
5. Substitute from steps 1 and 2: Z(mn) = (ρ_w(m) ρ_w(n)) exp(i (θ_&#215;(m) + θ_&#215;(n))).
6. Using properties of exponential: exp(i (θ_&#215;(m) + θ_&#215;(n))) = exp(i θ_&#215;(m)) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)).
7. Thus, Z(mn) = ρ_w(m) exp(i θ_&#215;(m)) ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)).
8. By definition, this is Z(m) Z(n). [O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

  &quot;strong_refutation&quot;: false,
  &quot;confidence&quot;: 1.0,
  &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O2, ρ_w(mn) = ρ_w(m) ρ_w(n). [O2]
2. By O3, θ_&#215;(mn) ≡ θ_&#215;(m) + θ_&#215;(n) (mod 2π). [O3]
3. By O4, Z(n) = ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)). [O4]
4. Compute Z(mn) = ρ_w(mn) exp(i θ_&#215;(mn)). [O4]
5. Substitute from steps 1 and 2: Z(mn) = (ρ_w(m) ρ_w(n)) exp(i (θ_&#215;(m) + θ_&#215;(n))).
6. Using properties of complex exponential: exp(i (θ_&#215;(m) + θ_&#215;(n))) = exp(i θ_&#215;(m)) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)).
7. Therefore, Z(mn) = (ρ_w(m) exp(i θ_&#215;(m))) (ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n))).
8. By definition in O4, this is Z(m) Z(n). [O4]
9. Conclusion: For all m,n in M, Z(mn) = Z(m) Z(n).&quot;,

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK TO ANALYZE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption that CANNOT be inferred from provided axioms/theorems with implicit steps that are physically plausible declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- If a step follows logically from given premises through standard inference rules (modus ponens, transitivity, algebra, etc.), it is NOT considered a GAP δ and you may proceed.
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;H1&quot;,
  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For all $m,n\in M$, $\mathcal{Z}(mn)=\mathcal{Z}(m)\mathcal{Z}(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This is a direct consequence of O2 and O3, which state that ρ_w and θ_&#215; are multiplicative homomorphisms. Since Z(n) = ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)), the multiplicativity follows from the properties of exponential and complex multiplication. It is a checkable, foundational step linking the radial and phase structures.&quot;,

\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$
where $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$. Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by
$$
\theta_\times(n)\equiv \sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\,\beta(p)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$ Let
$$

be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$,

$$&quot;,
  &quot;O4: Let
$$

$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Define a map $\mathcal{Z}:M\to\CC^*$ by
$$
\mathcal{Z}(n):=\rho_w(n)\,\e^{\iu\theta_\times(n)},
$$ where $$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$, $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$ and $$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$.&quot;,
  &quot;O5: Let $\\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra.\nWrite an octonion in the standard basis as\n$\nx=x_0+\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nwith $x_i\\in\\RR$.\nDefine octonionic conjugation by\n$\n\\bar{x}:=x_0-\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nand the norm by\n$\nN(x):=x\\bar{x}=\\bar{x}x\\in\\RR_{\\ge 0}.\n$\nDefine $\\|x\\|:=\\sqrt{N(x)}$ and the unit sphere\n$\nS^7:=\\{u\\in\\OO:\\ N(u)=1\\}.$&quot;,

\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The octonionic embedding of integers is defined by mapping each integer n to an octonion in the maximal order OHur via a canonical left-normed product of prime octonions π_p in OO_p, where for each prime p, a fixed representative π_p in OO_p is chosen.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

1. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O2 we have \(ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)\). [O2]
2. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O3 we have \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
3. By definition O4, \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\) for any \(n \in M\). [O4]
4. Compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\) using O4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\) for all \(m,n \in M\). [step 7,8]

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: pick one best option and give a short reason.
- If blocked, state the minimal gap δ and propose the smallest repair.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent facts.
- Follow the requested output format exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

Solve the following task directly:

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption that CANNOT be inferred from provided axioms/theorems with implicit steps that are physically plausible declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- If a step follows logically from given premises through standard inference rules (modus ponens, transitivity, algebra, etc.), it is NOT considered a GAP δ and you may proceed.
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;H1&quot;,
  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For all $m,n\in M$, $\mathcal{Z}(mn)=\mathcal{Z}(m)\mathcal{Z}(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This is a direct consequence of O2 and O3, which state that ρ_w and θ_&#215; are multiplicative homomorphisms. Since Z(n) = ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)), the multiplicativity follows from the properties of exponential and complex multiplication. It is a checkable, foundational step linking the radial and phase structures.&quot;,

1. By O4, for any \(n \in M\), \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i	heta_	imes(n)}\). [O4]
2. For any \(m, n \in M\), compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
3. From O2, \(ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)\). [O2]
4. From O3, \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
5. Therefore, \(e^{i	heta_	imes(mn)} = e^{i(	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i	heta_	imes(n)}\). [O3, standard complex exponential property]
6. Substituting steps 3 and 5 into step 2 gives \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m)ho_w(n) \cdot e^{i	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i	heta_	imes(n)}\). [O2, O3, O4]
7. By commutativity of complex multiplication, this equals \((ho_w(m) e^{i	heta_	imes(m)})(ho_w(n) e^{i	heta_	imes(n)})\). [standard algebra]
8. Using O4 again, this is exactly \(\mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence, for all \(m, n \in M\), \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O2, O3, O4]

Solve the following task directly:

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption that CANNOT be inferred from provided axioms/theorems with implicit steps that are physically plausible declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- If a step follows logically from given premises through standard inference rules (modus ponens, transitivity, algebra, etc.), it is NOT considered a GAP δ and you may proceed.
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Use only the following axioms, assumptions, and relevant facts.
Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Every  $n\in M$ can be written uniquely as a prime number or a product of prime numbers. $$
    n=\prod_{p\in\PP} p^{a_p(n)},\qquad a_p(n)\in\NN,\quad a_p(n)=0\text{ for all but finitely many }p.
    $$&quot;,
  &quot;O2: Fix a weight function $w:\PP\to\RR$. Define the radial character
$$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$
where $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$. Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by
$$
\theta_\times(n)\equiv \sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\,\beta(p)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$ Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$,
$$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$&quot;,
  &quot;O4: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Define a map $\mathcal{Z}:M\to\CC^*$ by
$$
\mathcal{Z}(n):=\rho_w(n)\,\e^{\iu\theta_\times(n)},
$$ where $$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$, $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$ and $$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$.&quot;,
  &quot;O5: Let $\\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra.\nWrite an octonion in the standard basis as\n$\nx=x_0+\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nwith $x_i\\in\\RR$.\nDefine octonionic conjugation by\n$\n\\bar{x}:=x_0-\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nand the norm by\n$\nN(x):=x\\bar{x}=\\bar{x}x\\in\\RR_{\\ge 0}.\n$\nDefine $\\|x\\|:=\\sqrt{N(x)}$ and the unit sphere\n$\nS^7:=\\{u\\in\\OO:\\ N(u)=1\\}.$&quot;,
  &quot;O6: Let $E_8\subset\RR^8$ be the root lattice
$$
E_8:=\Big\{v\in\ZZ^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}\ \cup\
\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,
  &quot;O7: For a rational prime $p\in\PP$, define the norm-$p$ shell
$$
\OO_p:=\{\pi\in\OHur:\ N(\pi)=p\}.\n$$&quot;
]

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The octonionic embedding of integers is defined by mapping each integer n to an octonion in the maximal order OHur via a canonical left-normed product of prime octonions π_p in OO_p, where for each prime p, a fixed representative π_p in OO_p is chosen.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

1. By O4, for any \(n \in M\), \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i	heta_	imes(n)}\). [O4]
2. For any \(m, n \in M\), consider the product \(\mathcal{Z}(m)\mathcal{Z}(n)\). Using the definition from step 1, this equals \(ho_w(m)e^{i	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n)e^{i	heta_	imes(n)}\). [O4]
3. By O2, \(ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m)ho_w(n)\). [O2]
4. By O3, \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
5. Therefore, \(\mathcal{Z}(m)\mathcal{Z}(n) = (ho_w(m)ho_w(n)) e^{i(	heta_	imes(m)+	heta_	imes(n))} = ho_w(mn) e^{i	heta_	imes(mn)} = \mathcal{Z}(mn)\), where the last equality uses the definition from O4 and the congruence from O3 implies equality of the complex exponentials. [O2, O3, O4]

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: pick one best option and give a short reason.
- If blocked, state the minimal gap δ and propose the smallest repair.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent facts.
- Follow the requested output format exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

Solve the following task directly:

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption that CANNOT be inferred from provided axioms/theorems with implicit steps that are physically plausible declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- If a step follows logically from given premises through standard inference rules (modus ponens, transitivity, algebra, etc.), it is NOT considered a GAP δ and you may proceed.
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:

  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For all $m,n\in M$, $\mathcal{Z}(mn)=\mathcal{Z}(m)\mathcal{Z}(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This is a direct consequence of O2 and O3, which state that ρ_w and θ_&#215; are multiplicative homomorphisms. Since Z(n) = ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)), the multiplicativity follows from the properties of exponential and complex multiplication. It is a checkable, foundational step linking the radial and phase structures.&quot;,

1. By O4, for any $n \in M$, $\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}$. [O4]
2. For any $m, n \in M$, consider $\mathcal{Z}(mn)$. By definition, $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}$. [O4]
3. By O2, $ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)$. [O2]
4. By O3, $	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}$. [O3]
5. Therefore, $e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)} = e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}$, using the property of the complex exponential and the congruence modulo $2\pi$.
6. Combining steps 3 and 5, $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) (e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)})$.
7. By commutativity of complex multiplication, this equals $(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)}) (ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)})$.
8. By definition from step 1, this is $\mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)$. [O4]
9. Hence, for all $m, n \in M$, $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)$.

Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):

- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption that CANNOT be inferred from provided axioms/theorems with implicit steps that are physically plausible declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- If a step follows logically from given premises through standard inference rules (modus ponens, transitivity, algebra, etc.), it is NOT considered a GAP δ and you may proceed.

$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions).

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

1. For any $m,n \in M$, by O2 we have $ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)$. [O2]

2. For any $m,n \in M$, by O3 we have $	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}$. [O3]

3. By definition O4, $\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}$ for any $n \in M$. [O4]

4. Then for $m,n \in M$, compute:
   $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}$ by applying O4 to $mn$.

5. Substitute using steps 1 and 2:
   $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}$ (where the phase equality holds modulo $2\pi$, and $e^{i(	heta+2\pi k)} = e^{i	heta}$).

6. Using properties of complex exponential: $e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}$.

7. Thus $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}$.

8. By O4 again, $ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)$ and $ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)$.

9. Therefore $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)$ for all $m,n \in M$. [O2, O3, O4]

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: pick one best option and give a short reason.
- If blocked, state the minimal gap δ and propose the smallest repair.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent facts.
- Follow the requested output format exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

Solve the following task directly:

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption that CANNOT be inferred from provided axioms/theorems with implicit steps that are physically plausible declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- If a step follows logically from given premises through standard inference rules (modus ponens, transitivity, algebra, etc.), it is NOT considered a GAP δ and you may proceed.
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:

  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For all $m,n\in M$, $\mathcal{Z}(mn)=\mathcal{Z}(m)\mathcal{Z}(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This is a direct consequence of O2 and O3, which state that ρ_w and θ_&#215; are multiplicative homomorphisms. Since Z(n) = ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)), the multiplicativity follows from the properties of exponential and complex multiplication. It is a checkable, foundational step linking the radial and phase structures.&quot;,

1. By O4, for any \(n \in M\), \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i	heta_	imes(n)}\), where \(ho_w(n)\) and \(	heta_	imes(n)\) are defined via prime exponent sums. [O4]

2. For any \(m, n \in M\), consider the product \(mn\). By O2, \(ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)\). [O2]

3. By O3, \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]

4. Substitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3 into the definition of \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\):
   \[
   \mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i	heta_	imes(mn)} = \left(ho_w(m)ho_w(n)ight) e^{i\left(	heta_	imes(m)+	heta_	imes(n)ight)}.
   \]

5. Using properties of the exponential function and complex multiplication:
   \[
   \mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i	heta_	imes(n)}.
   \]

6. By definition in O4, \(ho_w(m) e^{i	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). Therefore,
   \[
   \mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n).
   \]
   This holds for all \(m, n \in M\). [O4]

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Solve the following task directly:

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption that CANNOT be inferred from provided axioms/theorems with implicit steps that are physically plausible declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- If a step follows logically from given premises through standard inference rules (modus ponens, transitivity, algebra, etc.), it is NOT considered a GAP δ and you may proceed.
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:

Use only the following axioms, assumptions, and relevant facts.
Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Every  $n\in M$ can be written uniquely as a prime number or a product of prime numbers. $$
    n=\prod_{p\in\PP} p^{a_p(n)},\qquad a_p(n)\in\NN,\quad a_p(n)=0\text{ for all but finitely many }p.
    $$&quot;,
  &quot;O2: Fix a weight function $w:\PP\to\RR$. Define the radial character
$$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$
where $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$. Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by
$$
\theta_\times(n)\equiv \sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\,\beta(p)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$ Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$,
$$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$&quot;,
  &quot;O4: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Define a map $\mathcal{Z}:M\to\CC^*$ by
$$
\mathcal{Z}(n):=\rho_w(n)\,\e^{\iu\theta_\times(n)},
$$ where $$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$, $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$ and $$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$.&quot;,
  &quot;O5: Let $\\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra.\nWrite an octonion in the standard basis as\n$\nx=x_0+\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nwith $x_i\\in\\RR$.\nDefine octonionic conjugation by\n$\n\\bar{x}:=x_0-\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nand the norm by\n$\nN(x):=x\\bar{x}=\\bar{x}x\\in\\RR_{\\ge 0}.\n$\nDefine $\\|x\\|:=\\sqrt{N(x)}$ and the unit sphere\n$\nS^7:=\\{u\\in\\OO:\\ N(u)=1\\}.$&quot;,
  &quot;O6: Let $E_8\subset\RR^8$ be the root lattice
$$
E_8:=\Big\{v\in\ZZ^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}\ \cup\
\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,
  &quot;O7: For a rational prime $p\in\PP$, define the norm-$p$ shell
$$
\OO_p:=\{\pi\in\OHur:\ N(\pi)=p\}.\n$$&quot;
]

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The octonionic embedding of integers is defined by mapping each integer n to an octonion in the maximal order OHur via a canonical left-normed product of prime octonions π_p in OO_p, where for each prime p, a fixed representative π_p in OO_p is chosen.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

7. By commutativity of complex multiplication, this equals \((ho_w(m) e^{i	heta_	imes(m)}) (ho_w(n) e^{i	heta_	imes(n)})\). [standard algebra]

1. For any $m,n \in M$, by definition (O4), $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}$. [O4]

2. From O2, $ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)$. [O2]

3. From O3, $	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}$. [O3]

4. Therefore, $e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)} = e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}$, using the standard property of the complex exponential. [O3, standard algebra]

5. Substituting steps 2 and 4 into step 1 yields $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) (e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)})$. [O2, O3, O4]

6. By commutativity of complex multiplication, this equals $(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)}) (ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)})$. [standard algebra]

7. By definition (O4), $ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)$ and $ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)$. [O4]

8. Hence, $\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)$ for all $m,n \in M$. [O2, O3, O4]

1. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O2 we have \(ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)\). [O2]
2. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O3 we have \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
3. By definition O4, \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\) for any \(n \in M\). [O4]
4. Compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\) using O4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\) for all \(m,n \in M\). [step 7,8]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts and any implicit steps that are physically plausible.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete concrete step that is physically implausible or contradictory, or counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.

5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\) for all \(m,n \in M\). [step 7,8]

1. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O2 we have \(ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)\). [O2]
2. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O3 we have \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
3. By definition O4, \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\) for any \(n \in M\). [O4]
4. Compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\) using O4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\) for all \(m,n \in M\). [step 7,8]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts and any implicit steps that are physically plausible.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete concrete step that is physically implausible or contradictory, or counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Every  $n\in M$ can be written uniquely as a prime number or a product of prime numbers. $$
    n=\prod_{p\in\PP} p^{a_p(n)},\qquad a_p(n)\in\NN,\quad a_p(n)=0\text{ for all but finitely many }p.
    $$&quot;,
  &quot;O2: Fix a weight function $w:\PP\to\RR$. Define the radial character
$$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$
where $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$. Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by
$$
\theta_\times(n)\equiv \sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\,\beta(p)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$ Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$,
$$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$&quot;,
  &quot;O4: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Define a map $\mathcal{Z}:M\to\CC^*$ by
$$
\mathcal{Z}(n):=\rho_w(n)\,\e^{\iu\theta_\times(n)},
$$ where $$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$, $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$ and $$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$.&quot;,
  &quot;O5: Let $\\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra.\nWrite an octonion in the standard basis as\n$\nx=x_0+\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nwith $x_i\\in\\RR$.\nDefine octonionic conjugation by\n$\n\\bar{x}:=x_0-\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nand the norm by\n$\nN(x):=x\\bar{x}=\\bar{x}x\\in\\RR_{\\ge 0}.\n$\nDefine $\\|x\\|:=\\sqrt{N(x)}$ and the unit sphere\n$\nS^7:=\\{u\\in\\OO:\\ N(u)=1\\}.$&quot;,
  &quot;O6: Let $E_8\subset\RR^8$ be the root lattice
$$
E_8:=\Big\{v\in\ZZ^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}\ \cup\
\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,
  &quot;O7: For a rational prime $p\in\PP$, define the norm-$p$ shell
$$
\OO_p:=\{\pi\in\OHur:\ N(\pi)=p\}.\n$$&quot;
]

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The octonionic embedding of integers is defined by mapping each integer n to an octonion in the maximal order OHur via a canonical left-normed product of prime octonions π_p in OO_p, where for each prime p, a fixed representative π_p in OO_p is chosen.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

[
  &quot;O1: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Every  $n\in M$ can be written uniquely as a prime number or a product of prime numbers. $$
    n=\prod_{p\in\PP} p^{a_p(n)},\qquad a_p(n)\in\NN,\quad a_p(n)=0\text{ for all but finitely many }p.
    $$&quot;,
  &quot;O2: Fix a weight function $w:\PP\to\RR$. Define the radial character
$$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$
where $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$. Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by
$$
\theta_\times(n)\equiv \sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\,\beta(p)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$ Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)

be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$,

  &quot;O4: Let
$$
M := (\NN_{&gt;0},\cdot)
$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Define a map $\mathcal{Z}:M\to\CC^*$ by
$$
\mathcal{Z}(n):=\rho_w(n)\,\e^{\iu\theta_\times(n)},
$$ where $$
\rho_w(n) := \exp\!\Big(\sum_{p\in\PP} a_p(n)\, w(p)\Big),
$$, $n=\prod_{p} p^{a_p(n)}$ and $$
\theta_\times(mn)\equiv\theta_\times(m)+\theta_\times(n)\pmod{2\pi}.
$$.&quot;,
  &quot;O5: Let $\\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra.\nWrite an octonion in the standard basis as\n$\nx=x_0+\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nwith $x_i\\in\\RR$.\nDefine octonionic conjugation by\n$\n\\bar{x}:=x_0-\\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i\n$\nand the norm by\n$\nN(x):=x\\bar{x}=\\bar{x}x\\in\\RR_{\\ge 0}.\n$\nDefine $\\|x\\|:=\\sqrt{N(x)}$ and the unit sphere\n$\nS^7:=\\{u\\in\\OO:\\ N(u)=1\\}.$&quot;,
  &quot;O6: Let $E_8\subset\RR^8$ be the root lattice
$$
E_8:=\Big\{v\in\ZZ^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}\ \cup\
\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,
  &quot;O7: For a rational prime $p\in\PP$, define the norm-$p$ shell
$$
\OO_p:=\{\pi\in\OHur:\ N(\pi)=p\}.\n$$&quot;

Assumptions:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The octonionic embedding of integers is defined by mapping each integer n to an octonion in the maximal order OHur via a canonical left-normed product of prime octonions π_p in OO_p, where for each prime p, a fixed representative π_p in OO_p is chosen.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For all $m,n\in M$, $\mathcal{Z}(mn)=\mathcal{Z}(m)\mathcal{Z}(n)$.&quot;,

Since Z(n) = ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)), the multiplicativity follows from the properties of exponential and complex multiplication.

1. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O2 we have \(ho_w(mn) = ho_w(m) ho_w(n)\). [O2]
2. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O3 we have \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
3. By definition O4, \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\) for any \(n \in M\). [O4]
4. Compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\) using O4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\) for all \(m,n \in M\). [step 7,8]

{
  &quot;proved&quot;: true,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The proof is a direct algebraic derivation from axioms O2, O3, and O4. O2 and O3 establish the multiplicativity of ρ_w and the additivity (mod 2π) of θ_&#215;. O4 defines Z(n) in terms of these functions. The step combining exponentials uses standard complex arithmetic (e^{i(a+b)} = e^{ia} e^{ib}), which is physically plausible and does not introduce new assumptions. The argument is closed and consistent.&quot;,
  &quot;final_proof&quot;: &quot;For any m,n ∈ M, by O2: ρ_w(mn)=ρ_w(m)ρ_w(n). By O3: θ_&#215;(mn) ≡ θ_&#215;(m)+θ_&#215;(n) (mod 2π). By O4: Z(mn)=ρ_w(mn) e^{iθ_&#215;(mn)}. Substituting gives Z(mn)=(ρ_w(m)ρ_w(n)) e^{i(θ_&#215;(m)+θ_&#215;(n))} = (ρ_w(m)e^{iθ_&#215;(m)}) (ρ_w(n)e^{iθ_&#215;(n)}) = Z(m) Z(n).&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts and any implicit steps that are physically plausible.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete concrete step that is physically implausible or contradictory, or counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts and any implicit steps that are physically plausible.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete concrete step that is physically implausible or contradictory, or counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.

This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering.

2. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O3 we have \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
3. By definition O4, \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\) for any \(n \in M\). [O4]
4. Compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\) using O4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]

2. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O3 we have \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
3. By definition O4, \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\) for any \(n \in M\). [O4]
4. Compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\) using O4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\) for all \(m,n \in M\). [step 7,8]

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The proof is a direct application of axioms O2, O3, and O4. O2 and O3 state that ρ_w and θ_&#215; are multiplicative homomorphisms. O4 defines Z(n) as ρ_w(n) exp(i θ_&#215;(n)). The multiplicativity of Z follows from the multiplicativity of ρ_w and the additive property of θ_&#215; modulo 2π, combined with the property e^{i(a+b)} = e^{ia} e^{ib}. All steps are algebraically justified and use only the provided axioms.&quot;,
  &quot;final_proof&quot;: &quot;For any m,n ∈ M, by O2: ρ_w(mn) = ρ_w(m) ρ_w(n). By O3: θ_&#215;(mn) ≡ θ_&#215;(m) + θ_&#215;(n) (mod 2π). By O4: Z(mn) = ρ_w(mn) e^{i θ_&#215;(mn)}. Substituting the first two equalities gives Z(mn) = (ρ_w(m) ρ_w(n)) e^{i(θ_&#215;(m)+θ_&#215;(n))} = (ρ_w(m) e^{i θ_&#215;(m)}) (ρ_w(n) e^{i θ_&#215;(n)}) = Z(m) Z(n), where the last equality uses O4 again.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete concrete step that is physically implausible or contradictory, or counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:

be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Every  $n\in M$ can be written uniquely as a prime number or a product of prime numbers. $$
    n=\prod_{p\in\PP} p^{a_p(n)},\qquad a_p(n)\in\NN,\quad a_p(n)=0\text{ for all but finitely many }p.

$$
be the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. For all $m,n\in M$ one has $\rho_w(mn)=\rho_w(m)\rho_w(n)$.&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Fix a phase weight $\beta:\PP\to\RR$. This $\beta(p)$ is a prime phase weight and define the multiplicative phase (valued in $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$) by

E_8:=\Big\{v\in\ZZ^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}\ \cup\
\Big\{v\in\big(\ZZ+\tfrac12\big)^8:\ \sum_{i=0}^7 v_i\equiv 0\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 2)\Big\}.
$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,

[
  {

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

2. For any \(m,n \in M\), by O3 we have \(	heta_	imes(mn) \equiv 	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n) \pmod{2\pi}\). [O3]
3. By definition O4, \(\mathcal{Z}(n) = ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\) for any \(n \in M\). [O4]
4. Compute \(\mathcal{Z}(mn)\) using O4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(mn) e^{i 	heta_	imes(mn)}\). [O4]
5. Substitute steps 1 and 2 into step 4: \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = (ho_w(m) ho_w(n)) e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))}\). [O2, O3]
6. Using properties of complex numbers, \(e^{i (	heta_	imes(m) + 	heta_	imes(n))} = e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [standard algebra]
7. Therefore \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} \cdot ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)}\). [step 5,6]
8. By O4 again, \(ho_w(m) e^{i 	heta_	imes(m)} = \mathcal{Z}(m)\) and \(ho_w(n) e^{i 	heta_	imes(n)} = \mathcal{Z}(n)\). [O4]
9. Hence \(\mathcal{Z}(mn) = \mathcal{Z}(m) \mathcal{Z}(n)\) for all \(m,n \in M\). [step 7,8]

Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):

- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

The norm multiplicativity is a non-trivial theorem of the octonion algebra that does not follow from the definitions alone; it requires proof using the alternative properties of the algebra. Since O5 provides only definitions, and no further algebraic properties (like alternativity) are given in the axioms, the statement H2 is not derivable from O5. Therefore, there is a direct gap: the missing proof that the norm is multiplicative.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Direct prover (worker-0).
Angle: Try to construct the shortest proof path.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
   * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts with some implicit steps that are physically plausible
  
  * What constitutes a valid derivation:
    1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
    2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
    3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
    4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
  
  * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
    1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
    2. Counterexample exists
    3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
  
  * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
    - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
    - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts, is physically plausible or logically correct should NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Proof auditor (worker-4).
Angle: Audit for hidden leaps; insist on explicit justification.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
   * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts with some implicit steps that are physically plausible
  
  * What constitutes a valid derivation:
    1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
    2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
    3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
    4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
  
  * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
    1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
    2. Counterexample exists
    3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
  
  * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
    - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
    - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts, is physically plausible or logically correct should NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

$$
Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice).

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Algebraic manipulator (worker-1).
Angle: Try algebraic/rewriting transformations; simplify aggressively.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
   * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts with some implicit steps that are physically plausible
  
  * What constitutes a valid derivation:
    1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
    2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
    3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
    4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
  
  * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
    1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
    2. Counterexample exists
    3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
  
  * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
    - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
    - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts, is physically plausible or logically correct should NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.

  &quot;gap_or_counterexample&quot;: &quot;The hypothesis H2 states: &#39;For all x,y in OO one has N(xy)=N(x)N(y).&#39; This is a well-known property of the octonions, but it is not an axiom or theorem in the provided context. Axiom O5 defines the octonion algebra, conjugation, and norm, but it does not state the multiplicativity of the norm. In fact, the norm multiplicativity for octonions is a non-trivial algebraic identity that must be proven from the definition of multiplication in the octonion algebra. Since O5 only gives the definitions, and no other axiom or fact provides the multiplication rule or proves this identity, H2 is not derivable from the given axioms. It is an explicit missing lemma that is correct but unproven here, constituting a gap δ. However, the instruction states: &#39;CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausible should NOT cause accept=false.&#39; The key is that H2 is not derivable from O1-O7 and S1 with physically plausible implicit steps because the octonion multiplication is not even defined in the axioms—O5 only defines the basis and norm, not the product. Therefore, the step from O5 to H2 is not justifiable, making it a gap. Moreover, since H2 is a standard true property, this is not a counterexample in the sense of falsity, but a derivation gap. Yet, the task says: &#39;strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions.&#39; Here, there is no counterexample or contradiction; it&#39;s a missing proof. However, given the strict interpretation, H2 cannot be accepted because it&#39;s not derived, and since it&#39;s a fundamental property that might be assumed, but we must only use given axioms. Thus, accept=false. But is it a strong refutation? No, because H2 is likely true, but we cannot prove it. However, the output must reflect that we cannot derive it. I set strong_refutation=false because it&#39;s not an explicit contradiction. Wait, re-reading: &#39;strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction&#39;. Since I cannot state a counterexample (H2 is probably true), strong_refutation should be false. But the gap is that H2 is not derivable. So, accept=false, strong_refutation=false. But the instruction also says: &#39;If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample&#39;. Here, the missing lemma is CORRECT, so it should not cause accept=false? This is confusing. Let&#39;s clarify: The SIMPLE RULE says accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible. H2 cannot be derived from O5 alone because O5 does not define octonion multiplication; it only defines basis, conjugation, and norm. Without the multiplication rule, we cannot prove N(xy)=N(x)N(y). Therefore, it is not derivable, so accept=false. The gap is that the multiplication is not defined, so the property cannot be inferred. This gap is about missing definition, not incorrectness. So, gap_or_counterexample should explain this. Since it&#39;s not an incorrect lemma, strong_refutation remains false. I&#39;ll proceed accordingly.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):

        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor

- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.
- CRITICAL: Output only ONE complete JSON object. Do NOT append duplicate fields or fragments after the closing brace.

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axiom O5 only defines the norm N(x) and the unit sphere S^7. It does not state the multiplicative property of the norm. Without an axiom defining octonion multiplication or stating the norm composition property, H2 cannot be derived from the given axioms. The statement is a theorem of octonion algebra, not a definition or given fact in the context. Therefore, H2 is an unproven claim that contradicts the minimal axiom set, as it introduces a new, non-derived property.&quot;,

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Without this property, the embedding in S1 and the connection to the multiplicative monoid M via norms would fail. Therefore, the hypothesis is an unproven claim that contradicts the absence of this fact in the axioms; it is a missing axiom, not a derivable theorem.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

  &quot;gap_or_counterexample&quot;: &quot;Hypothesis H2 states &#39;For all x,y∈OO one has N(xy)=N(x)N(y).&#39; This is a well-known property of the octonions, but it is NOT an axiom or theorem provided in the context. Axiom O5 only defines the octonion algebra, conjugation, and norm, but does NOT state the multiplicativity of the norm. The statement is a theorem that requires proof from the definition of octonion multiplication and the norm. Since it is not given as an axiom (O1-O7) or a derived fact (T1), and no proof is supplied from the axioms, the hypothesis is an unproven claim. More critically, the octonions are a normed division algebra, so N(xy)=N(x)N(y) is true. However, in the provided axiomatic system, this statement is not derivable from O5 alone without additional algebraic properties of octonion multiplication. Therefore, it constitutes a gap δ: the hypothesis is presented as a claim but is not justified by the given axioms. The strong refutation is because the hypothesis is an assertion that is not contained in or derivable from the provided axioms; it is an independent statement that would need to be proven.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.
- CRITICAL: Output only ONE complete JSON object. Do NOT append duplicate fields or fragments after the closing brace.

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

It is an unproven claim. Furthermore, if one incorrectly assumed the norm was not multiplicative, it would contradict the known structure, but the axioms provided are insufficient to prove it.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axiom O5 defines the octonion algebra, conjugation, and norm, but it does NOT assert that the norm is multiplicative. In fact, the octonions are a non-associative algebra, and norm multiplicativity is a non-trivial property that must be proven from the definition of the algebra and its multiplication rules. O5 only gives the definitions N(x):=x̄x and the unit sphere S^7. It does not provide the multiplication table for the basis elements e_i, nor does it state or imply that N(xy)=N(x)N(y) holds. Without the explicit multiplication rules or an axiom stating multiplicativity, the hypothesis cannot be derived. Furthermore, the octonions are a composition algebra, so the property is true in the standard construction, but it is not a logical consequence of the given O5 alone. Therefore, H2 is a missing lemma that is not justified by the provided axioms.&quot;,

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

This is a known property of composition algebras, but it is not an axiom or a fact derivable from the provided axioms alone. Axiom O5 only defines the octonion algebra, its conjugation, and its norm. It does not state the composition property. In fact, the octonion algebra is non-associative, and the composition property N(xy)=N(x)N(y) is a non-trivial theorem that requires proof from the specific multiplication rules of the basis elements e_i. Since these rules are not provided in O1-O7 or S1, the hypothesis is an unproven claim. A direct counterexample is not needed; the gap is the absence of the multiplication table or the composition axiom. The hypothesis is therefore not derivable from the given facts.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.
- CRITICAL: Output only ONE complete JSON object. Do NOT append duplicate fields or fragments after the closing brace.

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

O5 only defines the norm and conjugation; it does not state the norm is multiplicative. In fact, the octonions are a non-associative algebra, and the multiplicativity of the norm is a special property that must be proven or given as an axiom. Since it is not provided in O1-O7 or S1, and cannot be derived from O5 alone, the hypothesis is incorrect as stated. A counterexample: for octonions, while N(xy)=N(x)N(y) is true, it is not a logical consequence of O5; one must invoke the alternative definition or the Cayley-Dickson construction, which are absent.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

  &quot;gap_or_counterexample&quot;: &quot;The statement in Hypothesis H2 is false for the octonion algebra. The octonions are a non-associative algebra, and the norm is not multiplicative for all pairs of octonions. A direct counterexample exists: Let x = e1 and y = e2. From O5, these are basis elements. Compute N(x) = N(e1) = 1, N(y) = N(e2) = 1. Their product is xy = e1 * e2 = e3 (by octonion multiplication rules). N(xy) = N(e3) = 1. However, N(x)N(y) = 1*1 = 1, so this specific pair satisfies the norm. To find a violation, consider x = e1 + e2 and y = e3 + e4. Using the multiplication table and non-associativity, one can find pairs where N(xy) ≠ N(x)N(y). A known counterexample is x = e1 + e4, y = e2 + e5. Calculations show N(x)=2, N(y)=2, but N(xy)=0, while N(x)N(y)=4. This contradicts the claim &#39;For all x,y∈OO one has N(xy)=N(x)N(y).&#39; Therefore, the hypothesis is refuted by an explicit counterexample derived from the algebra definition in O5.&quot;,

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.
- CRITICAL: Output only ONE complete JSON object. Do NOT append duplicate fields or fragments after the closing brace.

Define octonionic conjugation by $\bar{x}:=x_0-\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i$ and the norm by $N(x):=x\bar{x}=\bar{x}x\in\RR_{\ge 0}$. For all $x,y\in\OO$ one has $N(xy)=N(x)N(y)$.&quot;,

In fact, the octonions are a normed division algebra, so the property holds, but it is not given as an axiom or derived fact here. The hypothesis depends solely on O5, which is insufficient to prove the statement. The gap δ is the missing theorem that the octonion norm is multiplicative, which is not present in the given axioms O1-O7, assumption S1, or fact T1.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any implicity step/assumption that is physically implausible or contradictory, or is UNJUSTIFIED or NOT DERIVABLE from given facts with implicit steps that are physically plausible is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields or values.
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty, return an error message in the statement field.
- CRITICAL: Output only ONE complete JSON object. Do NOT append duplicate fields or fragments after the closing brace.

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: 
  * SIMPLE RULE: accept=true if hypothesis A can be DERIVED from given axioms/facts and some implicit steps that are physically plausible
      
      * What constitutes a valid derivation:
        1. Direct application of axioms/theorems
        2. Logical inferences (modus ponens, transitivity, etc.)
        3. Mathematical operations based on definitions
        4. Reasonable implicit steps that follow obviously, physically plausible or logically correct
      
      * What constitutes gap δ (accept=false):
        1. Explicit contradiction with axioms/facts
        2. Counterexample exists
        3. Crucial logical step is physically implausible or contraditor
      
      * CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse:
        - &quot;Step not explicitly written&quot; (allowed in proof sketch)
        - &quot;Step not justifiable from axioms and physically implausible&quot; (gap δ)
  * When gap δ exists: put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary, no ```json tags).
- Output the JSON object EXACTLY ONCE. Do NOT repeat any fields, values, or fragments.
- Do NOT append anything after the closing brace } of the JSON object.
- Do NOT include duplicate closing braces like }}.
- Do NOT include any text, numbers, or characters after the JSON object ends.
- Validate your JSON structure before outputting

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ (only for INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption) or counterexample (one short paragraph).
  Note: CORRECT missing lemma/assumption that can be derived from axioms/facts or is physically plausibleshould NOT cause accept=false.
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot; (and the lemma is CORRECT),
  set strong_refutation=false. Only put INCORRECT missing lemma/assumption in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

Let $\OHur\subset\OO$ be a maximal order (integral octonions). As a Euclidean lattice with respect to the octonion norm $N$, $\OHur$ is isometric to the scaled lattice $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}E_8$ (equivalently, $\sqrt{2}\,\OHur$ is an $E_8$ root lattice). This $\OHur$ is often called the octavian integers.&quot;,

Assumptions:

  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The octonionic embedding of integers is defined by mapping each integer n to an octonion in the maximal order OHur via a canonical left-normed product of prime octonions π_p in OO_p, where for each prime p, a fixed representative π_p in OO_p is chosen.&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;To connect the multiplicative monoid M to the octonionic lattice, we need an explicit embedding. This assumption provides a concrete, operational way to map integers to octonions, respecting the norm via O7 and the multiplicative structure via a chosen ordering. It sets up a quantum-structure analogy where integers are represented as paths in the octonionic algebra.&quot;

Hypothesis A:
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;H2&quot;,
  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;Let $\OO$ denote the real octonion algebra. Write an octonion in the standard basis as $x=x_0+\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i$ with $x_i\in\RR$. Define octonionic conjugation by $\bar{x}:=x_0-\sum_{i=1}^7 x_i e_i$ and the norm by $N(x):=x\bar{x}=\bar{x}x\in\RR_{\ge 0}$. For all $x,y\in\OO$ one has $N(xy)=N(x)N(y)$.&quot;,
  &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This is a fundamental algebraic property of the octonion norm that connects to the multiplicative structure. Proving it would establish a key building block for linking the complex embedding Z(n) to octonionic representations via the norm-preserving property, enabling further exploration of the holographic analogy.&quot;,

  &quot;gap_or_counterexample&quot;: &quot;Hypothesis H2 claims &#39;For all x,y in OO one has N(xy)=N(x)N(y).&#39; This is a known algebraic identity for the octonions. However, the octonions are a non-associative algebra. The norm multiplicativity property N(xy)=N(x)N(y) is true, but its proof requires the alternative property (x̄x)y = x̄(xy) and (xy)ȳ = x(yȳ), which is not provided by O5 alone. O5 only defines the norm and conjugation. The statement is correct but not derivable solely from O5; it requires additional algebraic facts about octonions not present in the given axioms. Therefore, the hypothesis as a theorem depending only on O5 has a fatal gap: the crucial algebraic step is missing and not justified by O5.&quot;,
