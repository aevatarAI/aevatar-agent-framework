<details><summary>System Prompt</summary><pre>
You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are the coordinator of an HPA-augmented Hypothesis Promotion Loop.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (Θ scan): time = iteration k (access order). A scan_target is computed later; do NOT invent it here.
- Factorization (generators): every hypothesis MUST carry:
    depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs (axiom/theorem IDs)
    factor_sequence: ordered generator list (your reasoning order; used for octonion/associator signals)
- Projection (readout): if a derivation would require ANY extra assumption/lemma not listed in depends_on,
  you must NOT smuggle it in. Keep the hypothesis narrow and mention the missing piece in motivation.

CRITICAL - EXTRACTION ORDER (follow this sequence):
1. FIRST: Extract axioms from raw_task. Each axiom is a line that begins with an ID prefix like &quot;O1:&quot; or &quot;A1:&quot;.
2. SECOND: Extract optional user guidance from raw_task (if present):
  - Focus / explore direction: the text under the header &quot;Focus (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This corresponds to the UI &quot;Goal&quot; field and should guide what hypotheses to propose next.
  - Seed hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;SeedHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    If absent, also accept legacy inline formats inside Focus like &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot; / &quot;InitialHypothesis:&quot;.
  - Existing hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This is a hypothesis pool that already exists and MUST be stored in state.existing_hypothesis for reference.
    CRITICAL: Extract ALL text after &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; until the next header (or end of raw_task).
    Preserve the exact format (multi-line, JSON array, or single line) as provided by the user.
  - Store these into state.focus, state.seed_hypothesis, and state.existing_hypothesis for later rounds.
    IMPORTANT: state.existing_hypothesis MUST contain the exact text extracted from &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; header.
  - If a user seed hypothesis includes extra premises not represented by allowed IDs, do NOT smuggle them in:
    either weaken the statement to be unconditional, or move the extra premise into motivation as a gap δ.
- Propose EXACTLY ONE additional assumption (S1) as a &quot;quantum-structure setup&quot;.
  - It does NOT have to be derivable from the axioms, but it should be plausible and NOT obviously inconsistent with them.
  - It MUST be explicit and operational (a concrete structural choice), not a vague slogan.
  - Typical good forms: &quot;the global state is the ground state of a local Hamiltonian on G&quot;, &quot;bulk/boundary code is realized by a tensor network of type X&quot;,
    &quot;local degrees of freedom are qudits of dimension d on vertices&quot;, &quot;a stabilizer / gauge constraint is imposed&quot;, etc.
  - This is NOT an axiom: record it under state.assumptions and cite it as [S1] when used.
- For depends_on/factor_sequence, use ONLY existing IDs:
  - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
  - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (exactly [&quot;S1&quot;])
  - Theorem IDs (only if present in the initial theorems list, e.g. &quot;T3&quot;)
- Seed current_hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL: MUST select from existing_hypothesis, do NOT generate new).
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is non-empty, select ONE hypothesis from it as the seed hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
  - If state.seed_hypothesis is also non-empty, prefer selecting a hypothesis from existing_hypothesis that aligns with seed_hypothesis.
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is empty, fall back to state.seed_hypothesis (if provided) or leave current_hypothesis as null.
  - The selected hypothesis MUST include depends_on and factor_sequence. If missing, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- The seed hypothesis MUST NOT rely on any extra premise/lemma.
  - Avoid conditional premises like &quot;if G is finite / if boundary area is finite / assume ...&quot;.
  - If you notice a missing lemma in motivation, that means the hypothesis is NOT suitable as the seed.
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

HYPOTHESIS PROMOTION LOOP (HPL)

AXIOMS (one per line, authoritative):
O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).
O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.
O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.

\]

Focus (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

SeedHypothesis (optional):


ExistingHypothesis (optional):
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

ContinueOnFailure:
True&quot;


EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW):
1. Search for the exact line &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task (case-sensitive, may have leading/trailing spaces).
2. If found, extract ALL text that follows this line until you encounter:
   - The next header line that starts with a capital letter followed by a colon (e.g., &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot;, &quot;AXIOMS:&quot;, &quot;Focus:&quot;, &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot;, etc.), OR
   - The end of raw_task
3. Remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted text, but preserve all internal line breaks, spaces, and formatting.
4. Store the EXACT extracted text in state.existing_hypothesis field in your JSON output.
5. Do NOT modify, reformat, or interpret the content. Preserve it exactly as provided.
6. If &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; is NOT found in raw_task, set state.existing_hypothesis to &quot;&quot; (empty string).

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (before outputting JSON):
- [ ] Did I search for &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task?
- [ ] Did I extract ALL text after that line until the next header or end?
- [ ] Did I include state.existing_hypothesis in my JSON output?
- [ ] Is state.existing_hypothesis a string (not null, not missing)?

Example:
If raw_task contains:
```
ExistingHypothesis (optional):
Hypothesis 1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.
Hypothesis 2: TM-score is length-independent.
ContinueOnFailure:
true
```

Then state.existing_hypothesis should be:
&quot;Hypothesis 1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.
Hypothesis 2: TM-score is length-independent.&quot;

(Note: The text &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot; is NOT included because it&#39;s the next header)

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).

You are Dependency minimalist (worker-2).
Angle: Try to reduce dependency set; prefer proofs close to axioms.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK TO ANALYZE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is identified with the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their respective global-minimum conformations are the same structure in conformation space. [O1]
3. O4 defines the TM-score between two structures as the maximum over superpositions of \( rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} rac{1}{1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2} \), where \( d_i \) is the distance between corresponding residues after optimal superposition. [O4]
4. If the two structures are identical, an optimal superposition aligns them perfectly, making all distances \( d_i = 0 \). [interpretation]
5. Substituting \( d_i = 0 \) into the TM-score formula gives each term \( rac{1}{1+0} = 1 \), so the average over L residues is \( rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} 1 = 1 \). [O4]
6. Therefore, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1, O4]

depends_on: [O1,O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their native structures are the same conformation in space.
3. For any pair of identical conformations, the distance \(d_i\) between corresponding residues is zero for all \(i\).
4. By O4, the TM‑score formula is \(rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} rac{1}{1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2}\).
5. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the formula gives each term as \(1/(1+0) = 1\).
6. The average over \(L\) terms is therefore \(1\). [O1,O4]

2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their respective global-minimum conformations are the same structure in conformation space. [O1]
3. O4 defines the TM-score between two structures as the maximum over superpositions of \( rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} rac{1}{1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2} \), where \( d_i \) is the distance between corresponding residues after optimal superposition. [O4]
4. If the two structures are identical, an optimal superposition aligns them perfectly, making all distances \( d_i = 0 \). [interpretation]
5. Substituting \( d_i = 0 \) into the TM-score formula gives each term \( rac{1}{1+0} = 1 \), so the average over L residues is \( rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} 1 = 1 \). [O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is identified with the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their respective global-minimum conformations are the same structure in conformation space. [O1]
3. O4 defines the TM-score between two structures as the maximum over superpositions of \( rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} rac{1}{1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2} \), where \( d_i \) is the distance between corresponding residues after optimal superposition. [O4]
4. If the two structures are identical, an optimal superposition aligns them perfectly, making all distances \( d_i = 0 \). [interpretation]
5. Substituting \( d_i = 0 \) into the TM-score formula gives each term \( rac{1}{1+0} = 1 \), so the average over L residues is \( rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} 1 = 1 \). [O4]
6. Therefore, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1, O4]

For identical structures, an optimal superposition aligns them perfectly, resulting in d_i = 0 for all corresponding residues. 4.

&quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;

Instructions:
1. Parse existing_hypothesis to extract individual hypothesis statements.
   - If multi-line text, each non-empty line is a hypothesis.
   - If JSON array, extract &quot;statement&quot; field from each item.
   - If single line, treat as one hypothesis.
2. For each hypothesis statement, normalize it (lowercase, trim, remove punctuation).
3. For each theorem in state.theorems, normalize its statement field.
4. Check if each normalized hypothesis statement matches at least one normalized theorem statement.
5. If ALL hypotheses have been proven (i.e., all have matching theorems), set &quot;all_proven&quot; as true, else set &quot;all_proven&quot; as false.




Output your response in this exact format:

Choose only one. 

EXAMPLE SCENARIO: 
- If there are 4 hypotheses in the pool and only 1 theorem that matches one hypothesis,
- Then 3 hypotheses remain unproven,
- Therefore output must be {&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: 4, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: 1}

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty or all hypotheses are already seen, return an error message in the statement field.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This operationalizes O1 for mathematical reasoning, allowing us to treat the native structure as a well-defined point in conformation space.&quot;
  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

User-provided seed hypothesis (optional, for context only):


Existing hypotheses pool (MUST select from here):
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

IMPORTANT: If the above &quot;Existing hypotheses pool&quot; appears empty or is just &quot;&quot;, this means state.existing_hypothesis was not properly extracted during init_state.
You should report this as an error in your response, as you cannot select from an empty pool.

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

User focus / explore direction (optional):

    &quot;strong_refutation&quot;: false,
    &quot;confidence&quot;: 0.95,
    &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O1, the native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For any fixed protein P, its native structure N_P is well-defined by O1. [O1]
3. The TM-score between N_P and itself is computed by the formula in O4 with d_i = 0 for all residue pairs. [O4]
4. When d_i = 0, each term in the sum becomes 1/(1+0) = 1. [O4]
5. Therefore, the sum over L residues equals L, and TM-score = (1/L)*L = 1. [O4]
6. Alternatively, T1 states that for any two proteins with identical native structures, TM-score = 1. [T1]
7. Here, the two structures are N_P and N_P, which are identical. [O1]
8. Thus, by direct application of T1 with the same protein, TM-score = 1. [T1]&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

You are Algebraic manipulator (worker-1).
Angle: Try algebraic/rewriting transformations; simplify aggressively.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK TO ANALYZE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;H1&quot;,
  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.&quot;,

  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[

    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The free energy landscape of a protein can be approximated by a continuous differentiable function with a unique global minimum corresponding to the native structure (O1).&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This operationalizes O1 for mathematical reasoning, allowing us to treat the native structure as a well-defined point in conformation space.&quot;
  }
]

RelevantFacts:
[
  {

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For a fixed protein, its native structure is identical to itself. This is a logical identity. [O1]
3. T1 states: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot; [T1]

Solve the following task directly:

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;H1&quot;,
  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.&quot;,
  &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This is a special case of T1 where the two proteins are the same protein. Since a protein&#39;s native structure is identical to itself, T1 should apply directly. This tests whether the identity case follows from the general theorem about identical structures.&quot;,

Use only the following axioms, assumptions, and relevant facts.
Axioms:

    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The free energy landscape of a protein can be approximated by a continuous differentiable function with a unique global minimum corresponding to the native structure (O1).&quot;,
    &quot;motivation&quot;: &quot;This operationalizes O1 for mathematical reasoning, allowing us to treat the native structure as a well-defined point in conformation space.&quot;
  }
]

RelevantFacts:
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;T1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;,

Context: &quot;HYPOTHESIS PROMOTION LOOP (HPL)

AXIOMS (one per line, authoritative):
O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).
O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For a fixed protein, its native structure is identical to itself. This is a logical identity. [O1]
3. T1 states: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot; [T1]
4. Applying T1 to the case where the two proteins are the same protein, their native structures are identical by step 2. [T1]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1, T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1, T1]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For a fixed protein, its native structure is identical to itself. This is a logical identity. [O1]
3. T1 states: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot; [T1]
4. Applying T1 to the case where the two proteins are the same protein, their native structures are identical by step 2. [T1]
5. Therefore, the TM-score between the native structure of this protein and itself is 1. [T1]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

Check if ALL hypotheses from existing_hypothesis pool have been proven as theorems.

Existing hypotheses pool:
&quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;

    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;,
    &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;By O1, the native structure of a protein is its global free energy minimum. For two proteins with identical native structures, these minima represent the same conformation. By O4, the TM-score is defined as (1/L) Σ 1/(1+(d_i/d_0)^2). For identical structures, an optimal superposition yields d_i = 0 for all i, making each term equal to 1. Therefore, the TM-score evaluates to 1.&quot;,

Instructions:
1. Parse existing_hypothesis to extract individual hypothesis statements.
   - If multi-line text, each non-empty line is a hypothesis.
   - If JSON array, extract &quot;statement&quot; field from each item.
   - If single line, treat as one hypothesis.
2. For each hypothesis statement, normalize it (lowercase, trim, remove punctuation).
3. For each theorem in state.theorems, normalize its statement field.
4. Check if each normalized hypothesis statement matches at least one normalized theorem statement.
5. If ALL hypotheses have been proven (i.e., all have matching theorems), set &quot;all_proven&quot; as true, else set &quot;all_proven&quot; as false.




Output your response in this exact format:

{&quot;all_proven&quot;: true, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}


OR


{&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: int, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: int}


Choose only one. 

EXAMPLE SCENARIO: 
- If there are 4 hypotheses in the pool and only 1 theorem that matches one hypothesis,
- Then 3 hypotheses remain unproven,
- Therefore output must be {&quot;all_proven&quot;: false, &quot;existing_hypothesis_count&quot;: 4, &quot;proven_theorem_count&quot;: 1}
