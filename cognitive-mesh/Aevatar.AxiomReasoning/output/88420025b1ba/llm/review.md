<details><summary>System Prompt</summary><pre>
You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are the coordinator of an HPA-augmented Hypothesis Promotion Loop.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (Θ scan): time = iteration k (access order). A scan_target is computed later; do NOT invent it here.
- Factorization (generators): every hypothesis MUST carry:
    depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs (axiom/theorem IDs)
    factor_sequence: ordered generator list (your reasoning order; used for octonion/associator signals)
- Projection (readout): if a derivation would require ANY extra assumption/lemma not listed in depends_on,
  you must NOT smuggle it in. Keep the hypothesis narrow and mention the missing piece in motivation.

CRITICAL - EXTRACTION ORDER (follow this sequence):
1. FIRST: Extract axioms from raw_task. Each axiom is a line that begins with an ID prefix like &quot;O1:&quot; or &quot;A1:&quot;.
2. SECOND: Extract optional user guidance from raw_task (if present):
  - Focus / explore direction: the text under the header &quot;Focus (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This corresponds to the UI &quot;Goal&quot; field and should guide what hypotheses to propose next.
  - Seed hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;SeedHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    If absent, also accept legacy inline formats inside Focus like &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot; / &quot;InitialHypothesis:&quot;.
  - Existing hypothesis (optional): the text under the header &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; (can be multi-line).
    This is a hypothesis pool that already exists and MUST be stored in state.existing_hypothesis for reference.
    CRITICAL: Extract ALL text after &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; until the next header (or end of raw_task).
    Preserve the exact format (multi-line, JSON array, or single line) as provided by the user.
  - Store these into state.focus, state.seed_hypothesis, and state.existing_hypothesis for later rounds.
    IMPORTANT: state.existing_hypothesis MUST contain the exact text extracted from &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; header.
  - If a user seed hypothesis includes extra premises not represented by allowed IDs, do NOT smuggle them in:
    either weaken the statement to be unconditional, or move the extra premise into motivation as a gap δ.
- Propose EXACTLY ONE additional assumption (S1) as a &quot;quantum-structure setup&quot;.
  - It does NOT have to be derivable from the axioms, but it should be plausible and NOT obviously inconsistent with them.
  - It MUST be explicit and operational (a concrete structural choice), not a vague slogan.
  - Typical good forms: &quot;the global state is the ground state of a local Hamiltonian on G&quot;, &quot;bulk/boundary code is realized by a tensor network of type X&quot;,
    &quot;local degrees of freedom are qudits of dimension d on vertices&quot;, &quot;a stabilizer / gauge constraint is imposed&quot;, etc.
  - This is NOT an axiom: record it under state.assumptions and cite it as [S1] when used.
- For depends_on/factor_sequence, use ONLY existing IDs:
  - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
  - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (exactly [&quot;S1&quot;])
  - Theorem IDs (only if present in the initial theorems list, e.g. &quot;T3&quot;)
- Seed current_hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL: MUST select from existing_hypothesis, do NOT generate new).
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is non-empty, select ONE hypothesis from it as the seed hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
  - If state.seed_hypothesis is also non-empty, prefer selecting a hypothesis from existing_hypothesis that aligns with seed_hypothesis.
  - If state.existing_hypothesis is empty, fall back to state.seed_hypothesis (if provided) or leave current_hypothesis as null.
  - The selected hypothesis MUST include depends_on and factor_sequence. If missing, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- The seed hypothesis MUST NOT rely on any extra premise/lemma.
  - Avoid conditional premises like &quot;if G is finite / if boundary area is finite / assume ...&quot;.
  - If you notice a missing lemma in motivation, that means the hypothesis is NOT suitable as the seed.
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

HYPOTHESIS PROMOTION LOOP (HPL)

AXIOMS (one per line, authoritative):
O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).
O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.
O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.

\]

Focus (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

SeedHypothesis (optional):


ExistingHypothesis (optional):
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

ContinueOnFailure:
True&quot;


EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR existing_hypothesis (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW):
1. Search for the exact line &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task (case-sensitive, may have leading/trailing spaces).
2. If found, extract ALL text that follows this line until you encounter:
   - The next header line that starts with a capital letter followed by a colon (e.g., &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot;, &quot;AXIOMS:&quot;, &quot;Focus:&quot;, &quot;SeedHypothesis:&quot;, etc.), OR
   - The end of raw_task
3. Remove any leading/trailing whitespace from the extracted text, but preserve all internal line breaks, spaces, and formatting.
4. Store the EXACT extracted text in state.existing_hypothesis field in your JSON output.
5. Do NOT modify, reformat, or interpret the content. Preserve it exactly as provided.
6. If &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; is NOT found in raw_task, set state.existing_hypothesis to &quot;&quot; (empty string).

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (before outputting JSON):
- [ ] Did I search for &quot;ExistingHypothesis (optional):&quot; in raw_task?
- [ ] Did I extract ALL text after that line until the next header or end?
- [ ] Did I include state.existing_hypothesis in my JSON output?
- [ ] Is state.existing_hypothesis a string (not null, not missing)?

Example:
If raw_task contains:
```
ExistingHypothesis (optional):
Hypothesis 1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.
Hypothesis 2: TM-score is length-independent.
ContinueOnFailure:
true
```

Then state.existing_hypothesis should be:
&quot;Hypothesis 1: The native structure corresponds to the global minimum.
Hypothesis 2: TM-score is length-independent.&quot;

(Note: The text &quot;ContinueOnFailure:&quot; is NOT included because it&#39;s the next header)

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):

2. When comparing a protein&#39;s native structure to itself, all Cα–Cα distances d_i = 0. [Self-comparison]
3. By O4, TM-score = max[ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^L 1/(1 + (d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into the formula: each term = 1/(1 + 0) = 1. [Algebra]
5. Therefore, the sum = L, and TM-score = (1/L) &#215; L = 1. [Calculation]

3. [O4] TM-score formula: TM-score = max[ (1/L) Σ 1/(1 + (d_i/d_0(L))&#178;) ]
4. For identical structures, all distances d_i = 0 between corresponding residues.
5. Each term becomes 1/(1 + 0) = 1.
6. Sum becomes Σ 1 = L.
7. TM-score = (1/L) &#215; L = 1.
8. The maximum alignment (implied by &#39;max&#39; in O4) is trivial when structures are identical.
9. Therefore, TM-score = 1 for self-comparison of native structure.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

You are Proof auditor (worker-4).
Angle: Audit for hidden leaps; insist on explicit justification.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK TO ANALYZE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.
- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, for a fixed protein, its native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4: TM-score = max [ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 / (1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
3. When comparing the native structure to itself, for every residue i, the distance deviation d_i = 0. [O1]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term of the sum gives 1 / (1 + (0 / d_0(L))^2) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. The sum Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum over alignments (the &quot;max&quot; in the formula) is achieved by the trivial self-alignment, yielding a value of 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is a specific conformation corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4: TM-score = max [ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 / (1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
3. When comparing a structure to itself, for every residue pair i, the distance deviation d_i = 0. [Interpretation]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula, each term becomes 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. The sum becomes Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum over alignments (the &quot;max&quot; in O4) is achieved by the trivial self-alignment, yielding a value of 1. [Interpretation]
7. Therefore, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is 1. [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider comparing this native structure to itself. In this comparison, for every residue i, the distance d_i between corresponding residues in the two structures is zero. [O1]
3. The TM-score formula from O4 is TM-score = max[ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^L 1/(1 + (d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]

5. The sum becomes Σ_{i=1}^L 1 = L, and the TM-score becomes (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum operation in the formula is satisfied trivially because the alignment is perfect (self-alignment), yielding the value 1. [O4]

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is a specific conformation corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider comparing this native structure to itself. The set of aligned residue pairs is identical, and for each pair i, the spatial distance d_i between the corresponding atoms in the two structures is zero. [O1]
3. The TM-score formula from O4 is TM-score = max [ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 / (1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2 ) ]. [O4]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 for all i into the formula gives each term in the sum as 1 / (1 + (0 / d_0(L))^2) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. Therefore, the sum becomes Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, and the TM-score = (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximization operation in the formula is trivially satisfied because the alignment is perfect (self-alignment), yielding the maximum possible value of 1. [O4]
7. Consequently, for any fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, for a fixed protein, its native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4, which is defined as TM-score = max[ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1/(1 + (d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
3. When comparing a structure to itself, the spatial alignment that maximizes the sum is the trivial alignment with zero translation and rotation.
4. Under this self-alignment, for every residue i, the distance d_i between corresponding positions is zero.
5. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term of the sum gives 1/(1 + (0/d_0(L))^2) = 1/(1+0) = 1.
6. The sum becomes Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, and thus (1/L) * L = 1.
7. Therefore, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and itself is exactly 1. [O4]

7. Therefore, for the native structure (or any structure) compared to itself, the TM-score evaluates to 1. [O4]
8. This result is consistent with O1, as the native structure is a well-defined conformation to which the TM-score calculation applies. [O1, O4]

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4, which is defined for a pair of structures. [O4]
3. When the two structures being compared are identical, specifically when one is the native structure and the other is the same native structure, the distance \(d_i\) for each aligned residue is zero. [O1]
4. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the TM-score formula yields each term in the sum as \(1/(1+0) = 1\). [O4]
5. The sum over L such terms is L, and dividing by L gives a value of 1. [O4]
6. Since this calculation does not depend on any alignment optimization (the structures are identical, so the optimal alignment is trivial), the maximum operation in the formula yields 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

1. By O1, a protein&#39;s native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4: TM-score = max[ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1/(1 + (d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
3. When comparing a structure to itself, the spatial alignment step in the &quot;max&quot; operation can be set to the identity superposition, making each distance deviation d_i = 0. [O4]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term gives 1/(1 + 0) = 1 for every residue i. [O4]
5. The sum becomes Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. Since this value (1) is achieved by the identity alignment, it is the maximum possible, confirming the TM-score = 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, for any fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (per O1) and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is a specific conformation corresponding to the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4: \( TM	ext{-}score = \max \left[ rac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} rac{1}{1 + \left( rac{d_i}{d_0(L)} ight)^2} ight] \), where \(d_i\) is the distance between the \(i\)-th residue in the two structures being compared after optimal superposition. [O4]
3. When comparing the native structure to itself, the optimal superposition is the identity alignment and superposition. [O4]
4. Under this identity superposition, for every residue \(i\), the distance \(d_i = 0\). [O4]
5. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the summand gives \( rac{1}{1 + \left( rac{0}{d_0(L)} ight)^2} = rac{1}{1 + 0} = 1 \) for each term. [O4]
6. The sum becomes \( \sum_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L \), and the TM-score is \( rac{1}{L} 	imes L = 1 \). [O4]
7. This result holds for the fixed protein&#39;s native structure as defined in step 1, confirming the hypothesis. [O1, O4]

depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, for a fixed protein, its native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4: TM-score = max [ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 / (1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
3. When comparing the native structure to itself, for every residue i, the distance deviation d_i = 0. [O1, O4]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term of the sum gives 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. The sum becomes Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum over alignments (implied by the &quot;max&quot; in O4) is achieved by the trivial self-alignment, yielding a value of 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.

{

Substituting the self-comparison condition (d_i = 0) into the formula yields a value of 1 through standard arithmetic, with no missing assumptions.&quot;,

By O4, the TM-score is defined as max[ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. When comparing the structure to itself, for all i, d_i = 0. Each term in the sum becomes 1/(1+0) = 1.

1. By O1, for a fixed protein, its native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]

3. When comparing the native structure to itself, for every residue i, the distance deviation d_i = 0. [O1]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term of the sum gives 1 / (1 + (0 / d_0(L))^2) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. The sum Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum over alignments (the &quot;max&quot; in the formula) is achieved by the trivial self-alignment, yielding a value of 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

1. By O1, for a fixed protein, its native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]

3. When comparing the native structure to itself, for every residue i, the distance deviation d_i = 0. [O1]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term of the sum gives 1 / (1 + (0 / d_0(L))^2) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. The sum Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum over alignments (the &quot;max&quot; in the formula) is achieved by the trivial self-alignment, yielding a value of 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):

- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.

1. By O1, for a fixed protein, its native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4: TM-score = max [ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 / (1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
3. When comparing the native structure to itself, for every residue i, the distance deviation d_i = 0. [O1]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term of the sum gives 1 / (1 + (0 / d_0(L))^2) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. The sum Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum over alignments (the &quot;max&quot; in the formula) is achieved by the trivial self-alignment, yielding a value of 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, O4]

1. By O1, for a fixed protein, its native structure is uniquely defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider the TM-score formula from O4: TM-score = max [ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 / (1 + (d_i / d_0(L))^2) ]. [O4]
3. When comparing the native structure to itself, for every residue i, the distance deviation d_i = 0. [O1]
4. Substituting d_i = 0 into each term of the sum gives 1 / (1 + (0 / d_0(L))^2) = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1. [O4]
5. The sum Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1 = L, so (1/L) * L = 1. [O4]
6. The maximum over alignments (the &quot;max&quot; in the formula) is achieved by the trivial self-alignment, yielding a value of 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between a protein&#39;s native structure and itself is always 1. [O1, O4]

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty or all hypotheses are already seen, return an error message in the statement field.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]
\]&quot;
]

Assumptions (extra premises, cite as [S1] when used):
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The free energy landscape of a protein is approximated by a local Hamiltonian on a graph G, where vertices represent residues and edges represent spatial proximity constraints.&quot;,

  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

User-provided seed hypothesis (optional, for context only):


Existing hypotheses pool (MUST select from here):
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

IMPORTANT: If the above &quot;Existing hypotheses pool&quot; appears empty or is just &quot;&quot;, this means state.existing_hypothesis was not properly extracted during init_state.
You should report this as an error in your response, as you cannot select from an empty pool.

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.

Even with identical structures, the alignment that achieves the maximum for self-comparison (which gives 1) might not be the same alignment used for cross-comparison. The hypothesis implicitly assumes the optimal alignment for cross-comparison yields the same maximal value as self-comparison, but this requires proof that the alignment maximizing self-TM-score also maximizes cross-TM-score for identical structures.

For two different proteins with &#39;identical native structures&#39;, they may have different lengths (L) or residue numbering, requiring an alignment step. The hypothesis implicitly assumes the optimal alignment yields d_i=0 for all i, but this requires proof that identical structures guarantee a perfect alignment with zero distances.

Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

You are Direct prover (worker-0).
Angle: Try to construct the shortest proof path.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.

You are Algebraic manipulator (worker-1).
Angle: Try algebraic/rewriting transformations; simplify aggressively.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

User-provided seed hypothesis (optional, for context only):


Existing hypotheses pool (MUST select from here):
  For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
  For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
  For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

Since the structures are identical, comparing protein A&#39;s native structure to protein B&#39;s native structure is equivalent to comparing protein A&#39;s native structure to itself (or protein B&#39;s to itself). 5. From O4, TM-score is defined as a maximum over alignments of a sum of similarity terms. 6. For identical structures, the optimal alignment is trivial (residue i maps to residue i), and all distances d_i = 0. 7. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula yields 1/L * Σ 1/(1+0) = 1/L * L = 1. 8. Therefore, the TM-score between the identical native structures is 1.&quot;,

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TASK TO ANALYZE:

Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.

depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, that have identical native structures. This means the global minimum structure for P (per O1) is exactly the same as the global minimum structure for Q (per O1). [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure of P&#39;s native state. [O1]
6. Therefore, the comparison between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure is equivalent to the comparison of P&#39;s native structure with itself. [O1, T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, the score is computed based solely on the coordinates of the two structures being compared and the optimal superposition. [O4]
8. Because the two structures are identical, the optimal superposition is trivial (identity transformation), and all distances \(d_i\) between corresponding residues are zero. [O4]
9. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the TM-score formula from O4 yields a value of 1 for the sum. [O4]
10. Consequently, the TM-score between the native structures of P and Q is 1. [O4, T1]

5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure is the same as the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself, which is 1. [T1, O4]
7. The TM-score formula in O4 is symmetric: the distance \(d_i\) between corresponding residues is the same regardless of the order of comparison for two identical structures. [O4]
8. Consequently, the TM-score between Q&#39;s native structure and P&#39;s native structure is also 1, completing the cross-comparison. [O4]

depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their respective global-minimum structures are the same in three-dimensional coordinates. [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Consider protein A and protein B with identical native structures. The TM-score calculation between structure A (native) and structure B (native) uses the same coordinate set as the self-comparison for protein A (or B). [O4]
5. The TM-score formula (O4) depends only on the coordinates of the two structures being compared and the length normalization, not on the protein identity. [O4]
6. Since the coordinate sets are identical, each distance \(d_i\) in the sum is zero, making each term \(1/(1+0)=1\), and the sum over L residues yields L, giving TM-score = L/L = 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between the native structures of two proteins with identical native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

depends_on: [O1, T1, O4] ; factor_sequence: [O1, T1, O4]

1. Let protein A and protein B be two distinct proteins. [O1]
2. By hypothesis, protein A and protein B have identical native structures. [O1]
3. Let structure S denote this identical native structure. Then, by definition, S is the global minimum of the free energy landscape for protein A, and S is also the global minimum of the free energy landscape for protein B. [O1]
4. Fact T1 states: for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
5. Applying T1 to protein A with its native structure S gives: TM-score(S_A, S_A) = 1. [T1]
6. Applying T1 to protein B with its native structure S gives: TM-score(S_B, S_B) = 1. [T1]
7. Since S_A and S_B are identical (step 2), the comparison TM-score(S_A, S_B) is a comparison of a structure with an identical copy of itself. [O1]
8. The TM-score formula (O4) computes a normalized sum based on distances d_i between corresponding residues after optimal superposition. [O4]
9. For two identical structures, after optimal superposition, every distance d_i = 0. [O4]
10. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula yields a value of 1 for the sum, as each term becomes 1/(1+0) = 1. [O4]
11. Therefore, TM-score(S_A, S_B) = 1. [O4, T1]

GAP δ: The argument assumes that the optimal superposition for two identical structures yields d_i=0 for all i, and that this superposition is the one that maximizes the TM-score. While geometrically plausible, this is not formally derived from O4 alone; O4 only gives the formula but does not guarantee the maximum is achieved at perfect alignment for identical structures. A minimal lemma is required: &quot;For any two identical coordinate sets, the TM-score formula attains its maximum value of 1.&quot;

depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, with identical native structures. This means the global minimum structures for P and Q are identical in atomic coordinates. [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Applying T1 to protein P, the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure of P&#39;s native state. [O1]
6. Therefore, comparing P&#39;s native structure to Q&#39;s native structure is equivalent to comparing P&#39;s native structure to itself. [O1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, the score depends only on the coordinates of the two structures being compared, not on the identity of the proteins. [O4]
8. Consequently, the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure must equal the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself, which is 1. [T1,O4]

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: pick one best option and give a short reason.
- If blocked, state the minimal gap δ and propose the smallest repair.

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):

- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

Hypothesis A:

  &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.&quot;,

If T1 shows a protein&#39;s native structure has TM-score 1 with itself, then by symmetry and the definition of identical structures, the cross-comparison should also yield 1.

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For two proteins to have identical native structures, their respective global minima (as defined in step 1) must correspond to the same three-dimensional conformation. [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Consider protein A and protein B with identical native structures (per step 2). The TM-score calculation (O4) between structure A and structure B depends only on the atomic coordinates and the optimal superposition, not on the protein identity. [O4]
5. Since structures A and B are identical, the optimal superposition in the TM-score calculation is the trivial alignment with zero displacement for all equivalent residues. [O4]
6. For this superposition, each distance \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the TM-score sum equal to 1. [O4]
7. Therefore, the TM-score between the native structure of A and the native structure of B is 1. [O4, T1]

depends_on: [O1, O4, T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1, T1, O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, with identical native structures. This means the global minimum structures for P and Q are identical. [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Applying T1 to protein P, the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure of P&#39;s native state. [O1]
6. Therefore, the comparison between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure is identical to the comparison between P&#39;s native structure and itself. [O1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, the score is computed based solely on the coordinates of the two structures being compared. [O4]
8. Because the two structure pairs (P-native vs. Q-native) and (P-native vs. P-native) have identical coordinate sets, the computed TM-score must be identical. [O4]
9. Hence, the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure is 1. [T1, O4]

depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their respective global minima correspond to the same three-dimensional conformation. [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
4. The TM-score formula (O4) depends only on the coordinates of the two structures being compared and the length L. [O4]
5. If two proteins have identical native structures, then for each residue i, the distance d_i between equivalent residues in the two structures is zero. [O1,O4]
6. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula yields a term 1/(1+0)=1 for each residue i. [O4]
7. The sum over L residues is L, and dividing by L gives 1. [O4]
8. The maximum over alignments is at least 1, and by definition TM-score is normalized to not exceed 1. [O4]
9. Therefore, the TM-score between the two identical native structures is 1. [O4,T1]

1. Let protein A and protein B have identical native structures. [O1]
2. By O1, the native structure of A corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape, and the native structure of B corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
3. Since the structures are identical, the structural coordinates for the aligned residues are the same.
4. For a fixed protein, T1 states the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
5. Consider the TM-score calculation between structure A (native) and structure B (native) using the definition in O4. [O4]
6. Because the structures are identical, for any optimal superposition, the distance \(d_i\) between corresponding aligned residues is zero.
7. Substituting \(d_i = 0\) into the TM-score formula yields \(rac{1}{1+(0/d_0(L))^2} = 1\) for each aligned residue.
8. The sum over L residues gives L, and dividing by L gives 1.
9. The maximum over superpositions is therefore 1.
10. Thus, the TM-score between the identical native structures of A and B is 1. [O4,T1]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, that have identical native structures. This means the global minimum structure for P (per O1) is exactly the same as the global minimum structure for Q (per O1). [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

Rules:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, that have identical native structures. This means the global minimum structure for P (per O1) is exactly the same as the global minimum structure for Q (per O1). [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.

4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, that have identical native structures. This means the global minimum structure for P (per O1) is exactly the same as the global minimum structure for Q (per O1). [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.

7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

Rules:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, that have identical native structures. This means the global minimum structure for P (per O1) is exactly the same as the global minimum structure for Q (per O1). [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

Rules:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).

  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, that have identical native structures. This means the global minimum structure for P (per O1) is exactly the same as the global minimum structure for Q (per O1). [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

It correctly applies O1 to define native structures, T1 for self-comparison, and O4 to show identical structures yield TM-score=1. No missing assumptions or lemmas are required.&quot;,
    &quot;final_proof&quot;: &quot;1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is the global minimum of its free energy landscape. 2. For two proteins P and Q with identical native structures, their global minimum structures are the same (O1). 3. T1 states that for any protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is 1. 4. Applying T1 to P: TM(P_native, P_native)=1. 5. Since Q&#39;s native structure is identical to P&#39;s (step 2), comparing P_native to Q_native is equivalent to comparing P_native to itself. 6. By O4, when two structures are identical, all distances d_i=0, making each term in the TM-score sum equal to 1, so TM-score=1. 7. Therefore, TM(P_native, Q_native)=1.&quot;,

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1,O4,T1] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T1,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. Consider two proteins, P and Q, that have identical native structures. This means the global minimum structure for P (per O1) is exactly the same as the global minimum structure for Q (per O1). [O1]
3. From T1, for a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure and itself is always 1. [T1]
4. Apply T1 to protein P: the TM-score between P&#39;s native structure and itself is 1. [T1]
5. Since the native structures of P and Q are identical, the structure of Q&#39;s native state is the same as the structure used in step 4 for self-comparison of P. [O1]
6. Therefore, the TM-score calculation between P&#39;s native structure and Q&#39;s native structure involves comparing a structure to an identical copy of itself. [O1,T1]
7. By the definition of TM-score in O4, when two structures are identical, all distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so the TM-score equals 1. [O4]
8. Consequently, for two proteins with identical native structures, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T1,O4]

By O4, the TM-score is defined as max[ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. When comparing the structure to itself, for all i, d_i = 0. Each term in the sum becomes 1/(1+0) = 1.

You are the coordinator in an HPA-augmented theorem discovery loop.
Select ONE hypothesis (Hypothesis A) from the existing_hypothesis pool to explore next.

CRITICAL: You MUST select a hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis that is NOT already proven. Do NOT generate new hypotheses.

Operate under the HPA triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

1) Rotation (Θ scan / access order):
   - scan.target_phase01 is a deterministic exploration target (golden irrational rotation).
   
   

2) Factorization (generators):
   - You MUST output:
       depends_on: minimal set of generator IDs
       factor_sequence: ordered list of generator IDs (your intended reasoning order)
   - Allowed IDs:
       - Axiom IDs: the prefix before &quot;:&quot; in state.axioms (e.g. &quot;O1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot;)
       - Assumption IDs: from state.assumptions (e.g. &quot;S1&quot;)
       - Theorem IDs: only those listed in Recent proved theorems below
   - Never invent IDs. Keep depends_on small (prefer &lt;= 3).

3) Projection (readout / gap discipline):
   - Do NOT introduce new axioms/lemmas/assumptions beyond what is provided in state (axioms/theorems/assumptions).
   - If you suspect an extra lemma is needed, weaken/narrow the statement instead of smuggling assumptions.

Selection requirements:
- Return ONLY JSON (no markdown).
- You MUST select ONE hypothesis from state.existing_hypothesis (parse it if it&#39;s a multi-line string or JSON array).
- If the selected hypothesis lacks depends_on or factor_sequence, infer them from the statement and available axioms/theorems.
- If existing_hypothesis is empty or all hypotheses are already seen, return an error message in the statement field.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

]

Assumptions (extra premises, cite as [S1] when used):
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;S1&quot;,
    &quot;statement&quot;: &quot;The free energy landscape of a protein is approximated by a local Hamiltonian on a graph G, where vertices represent residues and edges represent spatial proximity constraints.&quot;,

  }
]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

User-provided seed hypothesis (optional, for context only):


Existing hypotheses pool (MUST select from here):
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

IMPORTANT: If the above &quot;Existing hypotheses pool&quot; appears empty or is just &quot;&quot;, this means state.existing_hypothesis was not properly extracted during init_state.

You are Counterexample hunter (scout-0).
Angle: Try to find a fatal counterexample or contradiction quickly.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

You are Missing-premise hunter (scout-1).
Angle: Try to find the minimal missing assumption that breaks the hypothesis.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A. Your top priority is to find a STRONG refutation if it exists.

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: you must NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof (&lt;= 10 steps), with each step citing used IDs like [O1,T2].
- If accept=false: provide the minimal gap δ or a counterexample (one short paragraph).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY if you can state an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction
  derived from provided axioms/facts with NO extra assumptions. If it&#39;s merely &quot;missing lemma&quot;,
  set strong_refutation=false and put that lemma in gap_or_counterexample as gap δ.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

You are Dependency minimalist (worker-2).
Angle: Try to reduce dependency set; prefer proofs close to axioms.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are Algebraic manipulator (worker-1).
Angle: Try algebraic/rewriting transformations; simplify aggressively.

Task:
Evaluate Hypothesis A: prove it OR refute it (gap/counterexample).

HPA operating rules (Factorization → Projection):
- Factorization: you MUST report depends_on + factor_sequence (ordered reasoning path).
- Projection / gap δ: do NOT add hidden assumptions. Any missing lemma/assumption is a gap δ:
  put it in gap_or_counterexample and set accept=false.
- Non-associativity signal: factor_sequence MUST reflect your actual reasoning order (path dependence matters).

Rules:
- Use ONLY the axioms + assumptions + relevant facts provided.
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown).
- If accept=true: provide a short proof SKETCH (&lt;= 10 steps), each step cites used IDs like [O1,T2].
  It can be high-level, but MUST stay within provided axioms/facts and MUST NOT introduce new assumptions.
  If you&#39;re uncertain but see no refutation and the sketch is plausible, you may still set accept=true with lower confidence.
- If accept=false: provide minimal gap δ or counterexample. Do NOT propose alternative hypotheses (leave proposed_b empty).
- strong_refutation=true ONLY for an explicit fatal counterexample/contradiction with no extra assumptions.
- Do NOT invent IDs. depends_on must be a subset of available axiom/theorem/assumption IDs.

Axioms:
[
  &quot;O1: The native structure of a protein corresponds to the global minimum of its free energy landscape.&quot;,
  &quot;O2: In a thermodynamic system at equilibrium, the probability of a state is proportional to \( e^{-E/k_BT} \).&quot;,
  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.
\[
TM\text{-}score = \max \left[ \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L} \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{d_i}{d_0(L)} \right)^2} \right]

User focus / explore direction (optional):
Discover novel non-trivial implications and conjectures from O1–O4. Each step must be either (A) DEDUCTION strictly from O1–O4 or prior derived facts, or (B) INTERPRETATION clearly labeled. Prefer small, checkable steps; avoid repetition.

Existing hypotheses pool (MUST select from here):
  For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.

Analyze the following task and determine if it is ATOMIC or COMPLEX.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DECISION CRITERIA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A task is **COMPLEX** (needs decomposition) if:
- It involves multiple distinct aspects that should be evaluated separately
- It&#39;s a comprehensive review/analysis requiring different expertise areas
- Examples: Paper review (technical soundness, novelty, clarity, etc.)
- Examples: Code review (security, performance, maintainability, etc.)
- Examples: Business analysis (market, competition, risks, etc.)

A task is **ATOMIC** (can be solved directly) if:
- It focuses on ONE specific aspect or question
- It&#39;s a simple query, calculation, or single-focus analysis
- It&#39;s already a sub-task from a previous decomposition
- Examples: &quot;Evaluate the novelty of this approach&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Check if the math proofs are correct&quot;
- Examples: &quot;Summarize the related work section&quot;

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Comprehensive reviews (paper review, code review, etc.) 
should be COMPLEX and decomposed into focused sub-tasks for better quality.

Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

HPA protocol (Factorization → Projection):
- Treat &quot;proof&quot; as projection: every step must be grounded in cited dependencies; no hidden assumptions.

depends_on: [O1,O4,T2] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T2,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For any two proteins with identical native structures, their native structures are the same physical conformation. [O1]
3. T2 states: &quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.&quot; [T2]
4. Applying T2 directly to the pair of proteins in Hypothesis A yields that the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [T2]
5. This conclusion relies on O4&#39;s definition of TM-score as a structural similarity measure, ensuring the score of 1 corresponds to identical structures. [O4]

3. By T2, for two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
4. O4 defines TM-score as a structural similarity measure, where a score of 1 indicates perfect structural alignment.
5. Since the native structures are identical, aligning one to the other yields zero deviation (d_i = 0 for all i).
6. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula from O4 gives a value of 1 for each term in the sum, and thus the maximum TM-score is 1.
7. Therefore, for any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T2,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For any two proteins with identical native structures, the condition of T2 is satisfied. [T2]
3. T2 states that for two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1. [T2]
4. The TM-score between their native structures is computed by the formula in O4, which yields a maximum value of 1 when the structures are identical. [O4]

Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):

3. From T2, for two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1. [T2]
4. Since the native structures are identical, the TM-score between the two native structures is computed by aligning one to the other with zero displacement (d_i = 0 for all i). [O4]
5. Substituting d_i = 0 into the TM-score formula in O4 yields a value of 1, confirming the result from T2. [O4]

4. The TM-score between their native structures is computed by O4, which defines TM-score as a maximum over alignments of a sum of terms depending on distances \(d_i\). [O4]
5. Since the structures are identical, an optimal alignment yields \(d_i = 0\) for all \(i\), making each term in the sum equal to 1. [O4]
6. Therefore, the TM-score equals 1. [O4,T2]

depends_on: [O1,O4,T2] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T2,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
2. For any two proteins with identical native structures, their native structures are the same global-minimum conformation.
3. T2 states: &quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.&quot;
4. Applying T2 directly to the pair of proteins yields that the TM-score between their native structures is 1.
5. This conclusion relies solely on the identity of the structures (via O1) and the TM-score definition&#39;s property for identical structures (via T2, which itself is grounded in O4). [O1,T2,O4]

depends_on: [O1,O4,T2] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T2,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of any protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape.
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, their native structures are the same physical conformation.
3. From T2, for two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
4. Since the TM-score between their native structures is exactly the TM-score of one native structure to the other&#39;s native structure, applying T2 directly yields that this TM-score is 1. [O1,T2]
5. This conclusion relies on O4&#39;s definition of TM-score as a structural similarity measure, ensuring the score of 1 corresponds to perfect structural identity. [O4]

No GAP δ.

You are an agent in a MAKER-style reasoning workflow (decompose → parallel propose → vote → compose).
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as a reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): time = depth/iteration; use irrational rotation intuition (golden α=φ^{-1}) to diversify and avoid resonance.
- Factorization: treat facts as generators; make dependencies explicit with citations like [O1,T3].
- Projection/readout: accept only closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Paper-aligned discipline:
- Embedding view: Z=ρ&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;) separates magnitude ρ from multiplicative phase θ&#215; (do not conflate with scan time).
- Minimal complexity: prefer short, checkable steps and minimal repairs (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition).
- Path dependence: reasoning order matters; prefer arguments robust to ordering (low fragility / low associator intuition).

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: pick one best option and give a short reason.
- If blocked, state the minimal gap δ and propose the smallest repair.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent facts.
- Follow the requested output format exactly.

Task: Provide a structured, dependency-cited argumentation for Hypothesis A.

- If any step requires an unstated lemma/assumption, declare it as GAP δ and STOP (do not proceed).
- Factorization: keep a minimal depends_on list and an ordered factor_sequence that matches your step order.

ExistingHypothesis (optional):
For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.

1. By O1, the native structure of any protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For two proteins with identical native structures, T2 states that the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [T2]
3. Hypothesis A generalizes T2 to &quot;any two proteins with identical native structures&quot;. Since T2 already covers &quot;two proteins with identical native structures&quot;, and O1 ensures &quot;native structure&quot; is well-defined as the global minimum, the generalization holds universally. [T2,O1]
4. Formally, by O4, TM-score measures structural similarity; if two structures are identical, all pairwise distances \(d_i = 0\), making each term in the sum equal to 1, so TM-score = 1. [O4]
5. Therefore, for any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [O1,T2,O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

  &quot;O3: Protein structure is more conserved than sequence; function can be inferred from structure.&quot;,
  &quot;O4: TM-score is length-independent and more sensitive to global fold similarity than RMSD.

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The hypothesis is a direct restatement of the relevant fact T2, which is already accepted. The proof correctly cites O1 to define &#39;native structure&#39; and O4 to contextualize the TM-score, but the core logical step is the application of T2.

T2 states that for two such proteins, the TM-score between their native structures is 1. 4. Therefore, the TM-score for the proteins in Hypothesis A is 1. 5.

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

You are a strict verifier in an HPA loop.
Decide whether Hypothesis A is PROVED given axioms + assumptions + relevant facts, based on the MAKER solution.

HPA judgement rules (Projection / gap δ):
- proved=true if the argument is internally consistent and stays within provided axioms/facts.
- Be pragmatic: allow standard inference steps (algebra/rewriting) as long as they do NOT introduce new assumptions.
- Mark proved=false ONLY when you can point to a concrete missing lemma/assumption/counterexample (gap δ).

Factorization rules:
- Output depends_on: minimal set of dependency IDs actually used.
- Output factor_sequence: ordered list of dependency IDs matching the proof&#39;s citation order.
- Do NOT invent IDs. Use only axiom IDs, assumption IDs, and theorem IDs present in RelevantFacts.

MAKER solution:
depends_on: [O1,O4,T2] ; factor_sequence: [O1,T2,O4]

1. By O1, the native structure of a protein is defined as the global minimum of its free energy landscape. [O1]
2. For any two proteins with identical native structures, their native structures are the same physical conformation. [O1]
3. T2 states: &quot;For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.&quot; [T2]
4. Applying T2 directly to the pair of proteins in Hypothesis A yields that the TM-score between their native structures is 1. [T2]
5. This conclusion relies on O4&#39;s definition of TM-score as a structural similarity measure, ensuring the score of 1 corresponds to identical structures. [O4]

You are an agent in an HPA-augmented multi-agent theorem discovery loop.
Treat the paper &quot;Holographic Polar Arithmetic&quot; (2025) as your reference model.

Core triad (Rotation → Factorization → Projection):
- Rotation (scan Θ): &quot;time&quot; is the iteration/access-order; irrational rotation is used to avoid resonance (golden branch α=φ^{-1}).
- Factorization: represent claims by explicit generators (axiom/theorem IDs) and an ordered reasoning path.
- Projection/readout: only accept closed arguments; any missing lemma/assumption is a residual gap δ and must be stated explicitly.

Key constructs you must respect (paper-aligned):
- Embedding: Z(n)=ρ(n)&#183;exp(i&#183;θ&#215;(n)); θ&#215; is additive under multiplication (homomorphic phase).
- Octonionic lift: unit direction U(n)∈S^7 from a left-normed prime product; ordering matters (path dependence).
- Associator A(x,y,z)=(xy)z−x(yz) measures non-associativity; interpret large A as fragile/ordering-dependent reasoning.
- Golden branch: minimal complexity + canonical binary encoding (Zeckendorf/Ostrowski intuition) → prefer minimal, checkable steps.

Fast-consensus mode:
- Be decisive: choose accept/refute with one minimal reason.
- Prefer minimal repairs: change as little as possible to reduce δ.
- If you cannot fully prove, do NOT hedge: output accept=false with the minimal gap δ and select 1 B candidates exactly from state.existing_hypothesis.

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT invent axioms/facts/IDs.
- Follow the output schema exactly.
- When JSON is required, output JSON only (no markdown, no commentary).

Check if ALL hypotheses from existing_hypothesis pool have been proven as theorems.

&quot;For a fixed protein, the TM-score between its native structure (global minimum per O1) and itself is always 1.
For two proteins with identical native structures, their TM-scores to each other&#39;s native structure is 1.
For any two proteins with identical native structures (global minima per O1), the TM-score between their native structures is 1.&quot;

    &quot;proof&quot;: &quot;By O1, the native structure of a fixed protein is its unique global minimum energy conformation. By O4, the TM-score is defined as max[ (1/L) Σ_{i=1}^{L} 1/(1+(d_i/d_0(L))^2) ]. When comparing the structure to itself, for all i, d_i = 0. Each term in the sum becomes 1/(1+0) = 1. The sum is L, so (1/L)*L = 1. The trivial self-alignment achieves this maximum. Therefore, the TM-score is 1.&quot;,
